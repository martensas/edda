\section{Cultural and religious terms and expressions (C)}
\begin{itemize}

\inxitem[C]{ape} (ON \emph{api}, OE \emph{apa}, OS \emph{apo}, OHG \emph{affo}, PNWGmc. \emph{*apó})
  In the Old Norse the word seems to mean ‘fool, buffoon’, in the other old languages apparently ‘monkey’, though this sense should be a later development of the former; why would the early Germanic tribes have a word for an animal that they had never encountered?

\inxitem[C]{aught} (ON \emph{ę́tt}, OE \emph{ǽht} ‘possession, property’)
  The Nordic (paternal) clan or family line.

\inxitem[C]{begale} (OHG \emph{bi-galan})
  To enchant, bewitch something or someone by singing a \inx[C]{galder}. Transitive of \inx[C]{gale}.

\inxitem[C]{bigh} (ON \emph{baugr}, OE \emph{béag}, OHG \emph{boug})
  Armlets used as currency during the Migration Period. — The giving of rings and armlets in exchange for loyalty (\inx[C]{holdness} being the word used for a warrior’s loyalty towards his lord, and of a lord’s grace towards his servants) was common across all of Germanic Europe, as seen in the many poetic ruler-kennings of the type “breaker of rings” (e.g. \emph{béaga brytta} ‘the breaker of bighs’ in \Beowulf\ ll. 35, 352, 1487). An illustrative example of this is \Hildebrandslied\ 33–35.
  This is also connected with the oath-ring, and the famous ring-swords. TODO? reference some literature on this.

\inxitem[C]{bloot} (ON \emph{blót}, OE \emph{blót}, OHG \emph{bluoz})
  A sacrifice or a sacrificial feast, one of the best attested Germanic pagan practices. The animals would be sacrificed by the host, cooked in large kettles and eaten communally. See also \inx[C]{bloot-house}.

\inxitem[C]{bloot-house} (ON \emph{blót-hús}, OHG \emph{bluoz-hús})
  A heathen temple. Glosses Latin \emph{fānum} in OHG. See also \inx[C]{harrow}, \inx[C]{hove}, \inx[C]{wigh}.

\inxitem[C]{Doom} (ON \emph{dómr}, OE \emph{dóm})
  Commonly ‘judgement, verdict’ (whence Doomsday, ‘Judgement Day’), in the Norse and Anglo-Saxon poetry often specifically referring to one’s fame or good reputation (that is, how others will judge one’s character and deeds), especially after death. It is clear that this verdict was of utmost importance to the ancient Germanic people. The clearest examples are \Havamal\ 77 (see there): \emph{I know one that never dies: the \textbf{Doom} o’er each man dead.} and \Beowulf\ 1384-1389, where Beewolf consols king Rothgar after Grendle’s mother has slain his trusted advisor Asher (\emph{Æschere}):
  \emph{Ne sorga, snotor guma! \hld\ Sélre bið ǽg-hwǽm, /
  þæt hé his fréond wrece, \hld\ þonne hé fela murne. /
  Úre ǽghwylc sceal \hld\ ende ge·bídan /
  worolde lífes; \hld\ wyrce sé þe móte /
  \textbf{dómes} ǽr déaþe; \hld\ þæt bið driht-guman /
  un·lifgendum \hld\ æfter sélest.}

  ‘Grieve not, wise man! ’Tis better for each one / that he avenge his friend than that he mourn much. / Each one of us shall suffer the end / of worldly life—win he who might / \textbf{Doom} before death: that is for the warrior, / unliving, afterwards the best.’
  Other illustrative examples in \Beowulf\ include 884b–887a:
  \emph{[...] Sige-munde ge·sprǫng /
  æfter déað-dæge \hld\ \textbf{dóm} un-lýtel /
  syþðan wíges heard \hld\ wyrm á·cwealde /
  hordes hyrde [...]}
  ‘For \inx[P]{Syemund} sprang up / after his death-day an unlittle \ken*{great} \textbf{Doom}, / since hard in conflict he defeated the \inx[C]{wyrm}, / the hoard’s herder.’
  and 953b–955a: \emph{[...] þú þé self hafast /
  dę́dum ge·fręmed \hld\ þæt þín \textbf{dóm} lyfað /
  áwa tó aldre [...]}
  ‘Thou hast for thyself / by deeds accomplished that thy \textbf{Doom} lives / for ever and ever.’

\inxitem[C]{feather-hame} (ON \emph{fjaðr-hamr}, OE \emph{feðer-hama}, OS \emph{feðar-}, \emph{feðer-hamo})
  A plumage which when donned by the wearer lets him fly like, or become a bird.  One is owned by Frow and used by Lock to fly between the homes in \Thrymskvida.  In the Christian \Heliand\ feather-hames are donned by angels who fly from heaven to earth.  See also \inx[C]{hame}.

\inxitem[C]{fee} (ON \emph{fé}, OE \emph{féoh})
  Originally ‘cattle, kine’, however also used in a broader sense to refer to one’s mobile wealth; for that cf. particularly \Havamal.

\inxitem[C]{fey} (ON \emph{fęigr}, OE \emph{fǽge}, OHG \emph{feigi} ‘cowardly’)
  Being doomed or fated to die, with a sense of predestination and inevitability.  Its earliest documented Scandinavian use is on the Rök stone: \textbf{aft uamuþ stąnta runaʀ þaʀ ᛭ n uarin faþi faþiʀ aft \emph{faikiąn} sunu} \emph{Apt Vámóð standa rúnaʀ þáʀ, en Varinn fáði, faðir aft \emph{fęigjan} sonu} ‘After Woemood (\emph{Vámóðr}) stand these \inx[C]{rune}[runes], but Warren (\emph{Varinn}) painted, the father after the \textbf{fey} son.’  See \textciteshorttitle{PCRN-HS} II:35, p. 928 ff. (TODO)

\inxitem[C]{feyness} (ON \emph{fęigð})
  The state of being \inx[C]{fey}.

\inxitem[C]{fimble-} (ON \emph{fimbul-})
  The ultimate, final, greatest.  See \inx[P]{Fimblethyle}, \inx[L]{Fimble-winter}.

\inxitem[C]{five days} (ON \emph{fimm dagar})
  The Old Scandinavian (and perhaps Germanic) week was originally five days long, the seven-day week being a later import, as seen by the names of the days, which are obviously calqued from the Latin (\emph{Dies Mercurii} = Weden’s day, et.c.).  According to the \Gulatingslog\ there were six weeks in a month, and “five days” is used as a generic period of time in \Havamal\ 51 and 74; in st. 74 it is contrasted with month.  Related to this is the legal term \emph{fifth} (ON \emph{fimmt}, OSw. \emph{fæmt}), a meeting or gathering set to be held at a five-day notice.  See \emph{fimt} in \CV, \textcite{LMNL} for further discussion.

\inxitem[C]{galder} (ON \emph{galdr}, OE \emph{gealdor}, OHG \emph{galdar})
  A magical song or incantation, probably synonymous with \inx[C]{leed}.  Verbal noun formed to \inx[C]{gale} ‘to sing, chant’.

\inxitem[C]{gale} (ON \emph{gala}, OE \emph{galan}, OHG \emph{galan})
  To sing, chant, especially of magical songs; verbal root of \inx[C]{galder} ‘something sung, chanted’.

\inxitem[C]{gand} (ON \emph{gandr}, Latin \emph{gandus})
  A witch’s familiar or foul spirit sent out to do her bidding. See \textciteshorttitle{PCRN-HS} I:17, p. 361 and II:26, p. 656. TODO

\inxitem[C]{gid} (ON \emph{goði}, OE \emph{Gydda} masc. given name)
  A heathen priest or master of ceremonies.

\inxitem[C]{gidden} (ON \emph{gyðja}, OE \emph{gyden} ‘goddess’)
  The womanly equivalent or wife of a \inx[C]{gid}.

\inxitem[C]{good of meat} (ON \emph{matar góðr}, \emph{góðr matar})
   An old formula appearing in \Havamal\ 39 and numerous Swedish Wiking Age Runic inscriptions Sm 39, Sm 44, Sö 130, U 703, and U 805.  Cf. U 739 which has the related \emph{mildr mataʀ} ‘mild of meat’.  Antonyms are \emph{matar illr} ‘evil of meat’ and \inx[C]{meat-nithing}.

\inxitem[C]{guest} (ON \emph{gęstr}, OE \emph{giest}, OS \emph{gast}, OHG \emph{gast}, Got. \emph{gasts}, PGmc. \emph{gastiz})
  Guests were often strangers, wanderers, who would come to beg for food and lodgings.  The Old Germanic peoples placed great value on hospitality. TODO.

\inxitem[C]{hame} (ON \emph{hamr})
  A skin, shape. People could “shift hames” (ON \emph{skipta hǫmum}), leaving their human hames behind and instead entering into the shapes of wolves, bears, birds.  During this process the original hame, that is, the human body, would be sleeping in a vulnerable state. A concise description of this is found in \YnglingaSaga\ 7: \emph{Óðinn \emph{skipti hǫmum}, lá þá búkr’inn sem sofinn eða dauðr, en hann var þá fugl eða dýr, fiskr eða ormr, ok fór á einni svipstund á fjarlæg lǫnd at sínum erendum eða annarra manna.} ‘Weden \emph{shifted hames}; then lay the trunk of his body as if sleeping or dead, but he was then a fowl or beast, a fish or serpent, and journeyed in a short while to foreign lands with his errands or those of other men.’.

  See also \inx[C]{feather-hame}, \inx[C]{town-riders}, \inx[C]{evening-riders}.

\inxitem[C]{harrow} (ON \emph{hǫrgr}, OE \emph{hearg}, PNWGmc. \emph{*harugaʀ})
  A hallowed cairn or stone-heap.  \Hyndluljod\ 10 describes the construction of one.  The Norwegian laws prescribe the “breaking of harrows and burning of hoves”.

  See also \inx[C]{hove}, \inx[C]{wigh}.

\inxitem[C]{hold} (ON \emph{hollr}, OE \emph{hold}, OS \emph{hold}, OHG \emph{hold})
  %TODO Mention: unhold wights, Old Saxon baptismal formula.
  ‘Favourable, loyal, gracious’, often of a ruler towards his subject (in the sense of ‘gracious, benevolent’) or vice-versa (in the sense of ‘loyal, devoted’).  Mirroring these earthly relationships, it is often used to refer to divine grace, both of the Christian God—thus in the \emph{Ecclesiastical Laws of King Cnut} \textciteshorttitle[372]{ALIE1}: \emph{Þam byþ witod-líce God hold, þe bið his hláforde rihtlíce hold} ‘Indeed God is \textbf{hold} towards him who is rightly \textbf{hold} to his lord’—but in the oldest Scandinavian material likewise of the Heathen gods.
  Thus \Lokasenna\ 4 (e.): \emph{holl ręgin} ‘\textbf{hold} \inx[G]{Reins}’, and \Oddrunargratr\ 10 (e.): \\ \emph{Svá hjalpi þér \hld\ hollar véttir,} \\ ‘So help thee \textbf{hold} \inx[C]{wights}; \inx[P]{Frie} and \inx[P]{Frow}, and more gods [...]’. %TODO: Numbering of Oddrunargratr is very uncertain.

  This word is common in old Scandinavian oath formulæ, e.g. in the elder redaction of the West-Geatish Law: \emph{Svá sé mér goð holl} ‘So may the Gods(!) be \textbf{hold} towards me,’ in medieval Norwegian laws (\textciteshorttitle{NGL2}[197,397]) and Grey-Goose (TODO: cite): \emph{Guð sé mér hollr ef ek satt segi, gramr ef ek lýg} ‘God be \textbf{hold} towards me if I speak truly, wroth if I lie,’ in Grey-Goose (TODO) also: \emph{Sé guð hollr þeim er heldr griðum, en gramr þeim er grið rýfr} ‘God be \textbf{hold} towards him who keeps the truce, but wroth against him who breaks the truce’. I refer to \textcite{Läffler1895} for further discussion on these formulæ.

\inxitem[C]{holdness} (ON \emph{hylli}, OE \emph{hyldu}, OHG \emph{huldí})
  Abstract noun formed to \inx[C]{hold}, meaning ‘favour, loyalty, grace,’ with the same semantics as the adjective.

  Notably, this word appears three times in connection with the grace of gods in the poetry, namely in \Grimnismal\ 43, where (according to my interpretation) the preparer of food at the bloot is said to earn the “\textbf{holdness} of \inx[P]{Woulder} and of all the gods;” and \Grimnismal\ 53 where the disgraced king Garfrith is said to have been bereft of the support \emph{gęngi} of Weden and all the Oneharriers, and of “Weden’s \textbf{holdness}” (\emph{Óðins hylli}).  “Weden’s holdness” is also mentioned in a stanza by Hallfred (edited as Hfr Lv 7 by Diana Whaley in \Skp\ V), who laments that: “The whole race of man has wrought songs to win the \textbf{holdness} of Weden; I recall the fully rewarded works of our kinsmen/ancestors.”

  From the semantics of this word the Germanic view on heavenly grace is clear: the Gods are \textbf{hold} towards those who do good works, which include swearing true oaths, faithfully observing truces, partaking in the bloot, following rules of hospitality, and composing poetry—and \inx[C]{gram} ‘wroth’ towards those who do the opposite.

\inxitem[C]{Home} (ON \emph{hęimr}, OE \emph{hám}, PNWGmc. \emph{*haimaʀ})
  In the Norse often referring to a realm in the cosmology (\Voluspa\ 2: “I remember nine \textbf{Homes}”, \Vafthrudnismal\ TODO: “From the runes of the \inx[G]{Ettins} and of all the gods I can speak truly, for I have come into each \textbf{Home}”). Thus \inx[L]{Ettinham} is the ‘\textbf{Home}/realm of the ettins’. When used on its own it means ‘the world (that we inhabit)’. See also \inx[L]{Nine Homes}, \inx[L]{Thrithham}.

\inxitem[C]{leat} (ON \emph{hlaut})
  In some saws explained as the blood drained from the offered animal; the verbal root is \emph{hljóta} ‘to get by lot’ and this word certainly refers to the use of the blood for auguries.

\inxitem[C]{leat-twig} (ON \emph{hlaut-tęinn})
  A twig used to sprinkle the \inx[C]{leat}.  The pattern of the blood would presumably be inspected for the augury; cf. \Hymiskvida\ 1.

\inxitem[C]{leed} (ON \emph{ljóð}, OE \emph{léod})
  A magical chant or incantation, as seen by \Havamal\ 153 near-synonymous with \inx[C]{galder}.  See also \inx[C]{gale}, \inx[C]{begale}.

\inxitem[C]{manwit} (ON \emph{man-vit})
  Common sense and wits.

\inxitem[C]{many-cunning} (ON \emph{fjǫl-kunnigr})
  Skilled with sorcery or the dark arts.

\inxitem[C]{meat-nithing} (ON \emph{mat-níðingr})
  One who is a \inx[C]{nithing} with food, i.e. one who does not properly furnish his \inx[C]{guest}.

  See also \inx[C]{good of meat}.

\inxitem[C]{nithe} (ON \emph{níð}, OE \emph{níþ}, OHG \emph{níd})
  Originally ‘hatred, emnity’.  In the Norse the sense has developed in the direction of ‘shame’, not just as a social abstract, but almost a tangible thing.  So the curse ritual of Eyel, where the curser will “turn nithe” (\emph{snýja níð} against his enemy to cause him misfortune.  \inx[C]{scold}[Scolds] would “compose nithe” (\emph{yrkja níð}) through singing slanderous verses, which likewise had an adverse supernatural effect on their subject.  See also \inx[C]{nithing}.

\inxitem[C]{nithing} (ON \emph{níðingr}, OE \emph{níþing})
  One afflicted with \inx[C]{nithe}; a villain, criminal.  Among the Scandinavians a legal term; a nithing could not swear oaths or bear witness and was forbidden to marry.

\inxitem[C]{orlay} (ON \emph{ørlǫg}, OE \emph{orlæg})
  One’s predetermined fate, destiny, purpose as decreed by the \inx[G]{Norns}.

\inxitem[C]{queer} (ON \emph{argr, ragr} (with metathesis), OE \emph{earg}, OHG \emph{arg})
  This derogatory adjective refers to gendered sexual deviancy, typically promiscuity for women and effeminacy or cowardice for men.  This is the reason for the present English translation.  Unlike the English word, the Old Germanich \emph{arg} was always a severe insult, and this from an early period; so the Longbeardish Edict of Rothari, codified in 643 AD: \emph{Si quis alium \emph{arga} per furorem clamaverit et negare non potuerit et dixerit, quod per furorem dixisset, tunc iuratus dicat, quod eum \emph{arga} non cognovisset; postea conponat pro ipso iniurioso verbo solidos duodecim. Et si perseveraverit, convincat per pugnam, si potuerit, aut certe conponat, ut supra.} ‘If anyone calls another man \emph{queer} in anger, and cannot deny it, and says that it was said in anger, then in his oath he says that he does not know him as \emph{queer}; let him thereafter settle for the insulting word with twelve solidi.  But if he persists, let him prove it by fighting if he can, or otherwise settle it as above.’

\inxitem[C]{queerness} (ON \emph{ęrgi, ręgi} (with metathesis))
  See \inx[C]{queer} above.

\inxitem[C]{rest} (ON \emph{rǫst})
  The distance between two rest-stops, a geographical mile (about 1850 metres).  See \CV: \emph{rǫst}.

\inxitem[C]{rune} (ON \emph{rún}, OE \emph{rún}, OS \emph{rúna}, OHG \emph{rúna}, Got. \emph{rúna}, PNWGmc. \emph{rūnu})
  An (esoteric) secret message or formula. That this—rather than ‘letter (of a Runic alphabet)’—is the original and proper sense is apparent from among others the Finnish borrowing \emph{runo} ‘poem; poetry; a division of a poem (specifically of the \emph{Kalevala})’, and its use in the singular in the earliest Runic inscriptions (e.g. Noleby Vg 63, which contains the linguistically indecipherable string of letters {ᚢᚾᚨᚦᛟᚢᛊᚢᚺᚢᚱᚨᚺᛊᚢᛊᛁᚺ[--]ᚨᛁ\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{ᛏ}ᛁᚾ}, a \emph{rune} in the proper sense or the recently discovered Svingerud fragment.) Thus, Weden’s taking of the \emph{runes} should not be interpreted as merely a myth for the invention of profane writing, but rather the origin of esoteric incantations, not at all unlike Indian \emph{mantras}.
  The word for letter was instead \inx[C]{stave}, see also there.

\inxitem[C]{scold} (ON \emph{skald})
  A Scandinavian court poet.  The name probably comes from their ability to slander with words.

\inxitem[C]{simble} (ON \emph{sumbl}, OE \emph{symbol})
  A banquet, symposium.

\inxitem[C]{soo} (ON \emph{sóa})
  To ritually waste, to slay in a sacrificial context.

\inxitem[C]{thill} (ON \emph{þylja})
  To recite poetry, sometimes of a lower quality, or poetic lists (so called \inx[C]{thule}[thules]) acquired by rote memorization.  See \inx[C]{thyle}.

\inxitem[C]{Thing} (ON, OE \emph{þing}, OS \emph{thing}, OHG \emph{ding})
  A (legal) assembly, where lawsuits would be settled and the law fastened.  See also \inx[L]{Thing of the Gods}.

\inxitem[C]{thule} (ON \emph{þula})
  A poetic list, typically of various items of a category (e.g. gods, legendary horses) or poetic synonyms (e.g. for swords, men, Weden). Degoratively also a ditty, poorly composed poem. See \inx[C]{thyle}.

\inxitem[C]{thyle} (ON \emph{þulr}, OE \emph{þyle}, PNWGmc. \emph{*þuliʀ})
  A sage who through rote learning has acquired a large amount of mythological lore (cf. \inx[C]{thule} ‘a list in poetic form; a ditty, bad poem’ and \inx[C]{thill} ‘to recite, to chant’).  Thus \inx[P]{Weden} is the \inx[P]{Fimblethyle}, being the unbeaten master of lore, as can be seen in his wisdom contests (like \Vafthrudnismal).  Runic inscription DR 248 (Snoldelev) suggests that the thyle may have tied to a specific place, and in \Beowulf\ it seems to have been a court position, with the poet Unferth being described (l. 1456) as the “Rothgar’s thyle”.

\inxitem[C]{wale} (ON \emph{vǫlr})
  The staff or sceptre of a \inx[C]{wallow}.  TODO: archeological finds, mention Sutton Hoo.

\inxitem[C]{wallow} (ON \emph{vǫlva}, OE \emph{*wealwe} (cf. ON \emph{svǫlva}, OE \emph{swealwe} ‘swallow’))
  A sibyl, seeress, oracle.  The word derives from the \inx[C]{wale}, a staff or sceptre probably used for ritual purposes.

\inxitem[C]{wigh} (ON \emph{vé}, OE \emph{wéoh}, \emph{wíh}, PNWGmc. \emph{*wīhą})
  A holy place or sanctuary. It seems that where the \inx[C]{harrow} was a pile of stones or cairn used for carrying out rituals, the \textbf{wigh} was an enclosed space. The earliest Norse attestation is the runic inscription Ög N288 (Oklunda), which reads: “Guther <= Gunnarr> painted these runes, and he fled, charged (with a crime, sought out this wigh, and he fled into this clearing. [...]” The implication seems to be that the wigh was considered so sacred that Guther could not be apprehended or punished for his crime while in it.

  In OE the word means ‘pagan idol’. It is not immediately clear which meaning is the original one, but in the present edition the Norse sense has been adopted, since the Anglo-Saxon sources are all of a Christian nature.  The name \emph{Wighstone} (\emph{Wíh-} or \emph{Wéohstān}) as found in \Beowulf\ in any case suggests it is the Norse meaning, since ‘idol-stone’ makes little sense.

\inxitem[C]{wode} (ON \emph{óðr}, OE \emph{wód}, PNWGmc. \emph{*wóduʀ})
  \inx[P]{Heener}’s gift to men, though the name may suggest it be from \inx[P]{Weden}. The word has several related meanings: ‘mind, (poetic) inspiration, rage’. See also \inx[P]{Woderearer}.

\inxitem[C]{wyrm} (ON \emph{ormr}, OE \emph{wyrm}, PNWGmc. \emph{*wurmiʀ})
  A dragon, serpent.  The distinction between “wyrm” and “worm; snake” is purely editorial and not made in the original languages.

\inxitem[C]{yin-} (ON \emph{ginn-})
  A rare augmentative prefix. TODO.

\inxitem[C]{yin-holy} (ON \emph{ginn-hęilagr})
  High holy, sacrosanct.  Used of the Gods in the formula \emph{ginn-hęilǫg goð} ‘yin-holy Gods’.

  An obscure god. \textcite{Rydberg1886}[552] has convincingly argued that he is connected with the stork, connecting his name with the Greek \textgreek{κύκνος} ‘swan’ and Sanskrit \emph{śakuna} ‘bird of omen’, and noting that his epithets \emph{langi fótr} ‘long foot’ and \emph{aurkonungr} ‘mud-king’ (both found in \Skaldskaparmal\ 22) accurately describe the stork. He gives \inx[C]{wode} TODO.

\inxitem[P]{Hell} (ON \emph{Hęl})
  Owneress of \inx[L]{Hell}.

\inxitem[P]{Hindle} (ON \emph{Hyndla})

\inxitem[P]{Thrim} (ON \emph{Þrymr})
  Ettin who steals Thunder’s hammer in \Thrymskvida\ and is later killed.

\inxitem[P]{Thunder} (ON \emph{Þórr}, OE \emph{Þunor}, OHG \emph{Donar}, PNWGmc. \emph{*Þonaraʀ})

\inxitem[P]{Wayland} (ON \emph{Vǫlundr}, OE \emph{Wéland, Wélund})
  A legendary smith captured by the tyrannical king \inx[P]{Nithad}.  In both the Norse \Volundarkvida\ and English \Deor\ he takes his revenge by first killing Nithad’s unnamed sons and then raping his daughter \inx[P]{Beadhild}.  In the Norse version he is married to \inx[P]{Harware Elwight}.

\inxitem[P]{Webthrithner} (ON \emph{Vafþrúðnir})
  An Ettin defeated by Weden in the wisdom contest in \Vafthrudnismal.

\inxitem[P]{Weden} (rhymes with \emph{leaden}; ON \emph{Óðinn}, OE \emph{Wóden}, \emph{Wéden}, OHG \emph{Wuotan}, PNWGmc. \emph{*Wódanaʀ} ‘Lord of \inx[C]{wode} (poetry, intelligence)’)
  Chief of the \inx[G]{Eese}, God of Wisdom, Galder, Poetry, War.  Husband of \inx[P]{Frie}, and by her father of \inx[P]{Balder}.  Father of \inx[P]{Thunder} by \inx[P]{Earth}.  Brother of \inx[P]{Heener} and \inx[P]{Lother} or \inx[P]{Will} and \inx[P]{Wigh}.

  A rather obscure god.  He is mentioned in connection with oath-rings (TODO) and the setting of ritual fires (\Grimnismal\ TODO). These obscure references are likely related to the interesting finds at Lilla Ullevi (‘the small \inx[C]{wigh} of Woulder’) in Upland, Sweden, consisting of several dozen fire striker-shaped iron amulet rings dating to 660–780 (for a detailed description see \parencite{afEdholm2009}).

\section{Groups and tribes (G)}
TODO: Map of rough tribal areas. Geneaologies.

\begin{itemize}

\inxitem[G]{All Gods} (ON \emph{ǫll goð})
  Occurs especially in ritual or ritual-adjacent use (\Grimnismal\ 43, \Lokasenna\ 11; cf. \Hakonarmal\ 18, where the piety of the dead king Hathkin is shown by his being greeted by \emph{rǫ́ð ǫll ok ręgin} ‘all the Redes and \inx[G]{Reins}’, and the prayer in \Sigrdrifumal\ 2–3, which collectively invokes the \inx[G]{Eese} and \inx[G]{Ossens}).  This suggests a native Germanic conception of Godly Oneness (Divine Unity); see also the \inx[L]{Thing of the Gods}, where the Gods convene and together steer the world.

  Similar expressions are found in other pre-Abrahamic religions, e.g. the Vedic \emph{víşve devā́ḥ} ‘All Gods’, to Whom are dedicated numerous hymns of \Rigveda, and the Greek \textgreek{Πάν·θειον}, that is, a temple dedicated to All Gods.

  The idea of Godly Oneness may have been disputed; an interesting anecdote is given by Saxo (i.7.2).  After Weden departs he is usurped by an obscure figure \emph{Mithothin} (perhaps “With-Weden”), who reforms the cult:

  {\small \emph{Cuius secessu Mithothyn quidam prestigiis celeber, perinde ac celesti beneficio vegetatus, occasionem et ipse fingende divinitatis arripuit barbarasque mentes novis erroris tenebris circumfusas prestigiarum fama ad cerimonias suo nomini persolvendas adduxit. Hic deorum iram aut numinum violationem confusis permixtisque sacrificiis expiari negabat ideoque eis vota communiter nuncupari prohibebat, discreta superum cuique libamenta constituens. Qui cum Othino redeunte relicta prestigiarum ope latendi gratia Pheoniam accessisset, concursu incolarum occiditur.}}

  {\small ‘A certain Mithodin, a famous illusionist, was animated at his departure as if by a kindness from heaven and snatched the chance to pretend divinity himself; his reputation for magicianship clouded the barbarians’ minds with the murk of a new superstition and led them to perform holy rites to his name. He asserted that the gods’ wrath and the profanation of their divine authority could not be expiated by confused and mingled sacrifices; so he arranged that they must not be prayed to as a group, but separate offerings (\emph{libamenta}) be made to each deity. When Odin returned, the other no longer resorted to his conjuring but went off to hide in Funen, where he was rushed upon and killed by the inhabitants.’}

  It is possible that this account reflects an historical attempted religious reform. It does not appear to have been successful.

\inxitem[G]{Danes} (ON \emph{danir}, OE \emph{dene}, PNWGmc. \emph{*daníʀ})
  A tribe in eastern modern-day Denmark and southern Sweden. They probably originated in Scania in southern Sweden, before moving westwards into the Danish isles and eventually Jutland, driving out the \inx[G]{Earls} and \inx[G]{Jutes}.

\inxitem[G]{Inglings} (ON \emph{ynglingar}, PNWGmc. \emph{*ingwalingóʀ} ‘the descendants of \inx[P]{Ing}’)
  The oldest known Swedish kingly lineage. The difference between this term and \inx[G]{Shelvings} is a bit unclear; \Beowulf\ knows them only by the latter term, while they seem to be used synonymously in the Norse sources.

\inxitem[G]{Nears} (ON \emph{njárar} \char`~ \emph{níarar})
  An old Swedish tribe mentioned in \Volundarkvida, where it is ruled by king \inx[P]{Nithad}.  The location may allow us to connect them with the Swedish province of Närke, cf. Old Swedish \emph{Næríkjar} ‘inhabitants of Närke’, \emph{Nærisker} ‘belonging to Närke’.  The Old Swedish stem \emph{nær-} (with unclear vowel length, though it is probably long) would then be a reduced form of \emph{níar-}, \emph{njár-}.

\inxitem[G]{Norns} (ON \emph{nornir})
  Supernatural women responsible for the fates (\inx[C]{orlay}s) of men.  Probably synonymous with \inx[G]{Dises}, \inx[G]{Mothers}.

\inxitem[G]{Ossens} (ON \emph{ǫ́synjur})
  The wives of the \inx[G]{Eese}, the goddesses.

\inxitem[G]{Oneharriers} (ON \emph{ęin-hęrjar}, OE \emph{*án-hęrgas})

\section{Places and events (L)}
\begin{itemize}

\inxitem[L]{Eastern Way} (ON \emph{Austr-vegr})
  In the mythology the eastern lands of the \inx[G]{Ettins}, to which \inx[P]{Thunder} goes to fight the Ettins and protect the realms of Gods and men.  Probably the same as \inx[L]{Ettinham}.
  In Scandinavian (especially Swedish) runic inscriptions this word refers to Eastern Europe and Asia.

\inxitem[L]{Ettinham} (ON \emph{Jǫtun-hęimr}, \emph{Jǫtna-hęimar})
  The ‘\inx[G]{Ettins}[Ettin]-\inx[C]{Home}’ or ‘home of the Ettins’; the eastern realm of chaotic and inhospitable beings.  See also \inx[L]{Eastern Way}, \inx[L]{Outyards}.

\inxitem[L]{Fimble-winter} (ON \emph{fimbulvetr})
  The great winter, which kills all humans apart from \inx[P]{Life and Lifethrasher}.

\inxitem[L]{Geatland} (ON \emph{Gaut-land, Gauta-land})
  The land of the \inx[G]{Geats}.

\inxitem[L]{Hell} (ON \emph{hęl}, PNWGmc. \emph{*halju}, Got. \emph{halja})
  The Underworld, personfied as and formally identical to \inx[P]{Hell}.  After the arrival of Christianity the word came to refer to the Christian hell-fire (= \emph{Gehenna}), which is the case in all attested languages apart from the Old Norse.  See also \inx[L]{Nivelhell}.

\inxitem[L]{Middenyard} (ON \emph{Mið-garðr}, OE \emph{Middan-geard}, OS \emph{Middil-gard}, OHG \emph{Mittil-gart}, Got. \emph{midjun-gards})
  The ‘Middle Enclosure’; the realm of men. See also \inx[L]{Osyard}, \inx[L]{Outyards}.

\inxitem[L]{Nivelhell} (ON \emph{nifl-hęl})
  ‘Mist-Hell’. From the poetic evidence it seems like it may originally have been a synonym for \inx[L]{Hell}.

\inxitem[L]{Osyard} (ON \emph{Ǫ́s-garðr})
  The ‘Enclosure of the \inx[G]{Eese}’; the heavenly realm.  See also \inx[L]{Middenyard}, \inx[L]{Outyards}.

\inxitem[L]{Outyards} (ON \emph{Út-garðar})
  Not Eddic.  The ‘Outer Enclosures’, described in \Gylfaginning. See also \inx[L]{Ettinham}, \inx[L]{Middenyard}, \inx[L]{Osyard}.

\inxitem[L]{Rakes of the Reins} (ON \emph{ragna rǫk})
  The ‘ultimate events of the \inx[G]{Reins}’, euphemism for the destruction of the world.

\inxitem[L]{Rakes of the Tews} (ON \emph{tíva rǫk})
  See \inx[L]{Rakes of the Reins}.

\inxitem[L]{Thing of the Gods} (ON \emph{þing goða})
  The Divine Council or Assembly, where the Gods convene and make decisions; a conception well known from Near Eastern literature.  Like the historical Germanic assemblies, the Thing is only attended by the male \inx[G]{Eese}, whereas the \inx[G]{Ossens} are \emph{á máli} ‘at speech’ (\Baldrsdraumar\ 1, \Thrymskvida\ 14).  The Thing is held every day at \inx[L]{Ugdrassle’s Ash}; Thunder wades to it, and the other Eese ride to it (\Grimnismal\ 29–30).  Thirteen Gods were present at the Thing: \inx[P]{Weden}, \inx[P]{Thunder}, \inx[P]{Nearth}, \inx[P]{Free}, \inx[P]{Tew}, \inx[P]{Homedall}, \inx[P]{Bray}, \inx[P]{Wider}, \inx[P]{Wonnel}, \inx[P]{Woulder}, \inx[P]{Heener}, \inx[P]{Foresitter}, \inx[P]{Lock}) (\Gylfaginning\ TODO).  With Lock excluded this makes twelve, which corresponds to the Old Germanic jury of twelve men.

  The Germanic Thing of the Gods has Near Eastern equivalents, including in the Hebrew Bible.  TODO.

  Occurrences: \Voluspa\ 6, 9, etc; \Baldrsdraumar 1; \Grimnismal\ 29–30; \Thrymskvida\ 14; \Hymiskvida\ 39.

\inxitem[L]{Thrithham} (ON \emph{Þrúð-hęimr})
  \inx[P]{Thunder}’s \inx[C]{home}.  See \inx[C]{thrith}.

\inxitem[L]{Up-heaven} (ON \emph{upp-himinn}, OE \emph{up-heofon}, OS \emph{upp-himil}, OHG \emph{úf-himil})
  Highest Heaven; used in \inx[F]{Earth and Up-heaven}.

\inxitem[L]{Walhall} (ON \emph{Valhǫll}, OE \emph{Wælheall})
  The Hall of the Slain owned by \inx[P]{Weden} and inhabited by the \inx[G]{Oneharriers}.
