\section{Cultural and religious terms (C)}
\begin{itemize}

\inxitem{aught}[C] (ON. \emph{ę́tt}, OE. \emph{ǽht})
  The Nordic (paternal) clan or family line.

\inxitem{bloot}[C] (ON. \emph{blót}, OE. \emph{blót}, OHG. \emph{bluóz})
  Sacrifice or a sacrificial feast.

\inxitem{Doom}[C] (ON. \emph{dómr}, OE. \emph{dóm})
  Commonly ‘judgement’ (whence Doomsday, ‘day of judgement’), but also specifically referring to one’s fame or good reputation after death. Thus \Havamal\ 77: “I know one that never dies: the \textbf{Doom} over each man dead.”; this is further illuminated by passages in \Beowulf\ such as 884b–887a: \emph{Sigemunde gesprong / æfter déaðdæge · dóm unlýtel / syþðan wíges heard · wyrm ácwealde / hordes hyrde} “For Sighmund sprang up after his day of death unlittle \textbf{Doom}, since hard in conflict the \inx{Worm} he defeated—the herder of the hoard.”; 953b–955a: \emph{þú þé self hafast / dę́dum gefremed · þæt þín dóm lyfað / áwa tó aldre} “Thou hast for thyself by deeds accomplished that thy \textbf{Doom} lives for ever and ever.”

\inxitem{fee}[C] (ON. \emph{fé}, OE. \emph{féoh})
  Originally ‘cattle’, however also used in a broader sense to refer to one’s mobile wealth. For this cf. particularly \Havamal

\inxitem{feelcunning}[C] (ON. \emph{fjǫlkunnigr})
  Skilled with sorcery.

\inxitem{fimble-}[C] (ON. \emph{fimbul-})
  The ultimate, final, greatest. See \inx{Fimble-thyle}, \inx{Fimble-winter}.

\inxitem{gand}[C] (ON. \emph{gandr}, Latin \emph{gandus})
  A witch’s familiar. See PCRN, Historia Norvegiæ. %TODO

\inxitem{hame}[C] (ON. \emph{hamr})
  A skin, shape. Individuals can through magic “shift hames” (ON. \emph{skipta hǫmum}), and leave their human \emph{hames} behind, instead entering into the shapes of wolves, bears, birds. During this process the original hame would be sleeping in a vulnerable state, as described in the Saw of the Walsings, chap. TODO: . See also \inx{feather-hame}, \inx{town-riders}, \inx{evening-riders}.

\inxitem{harrow}[C] (ON. \emph{hǫrgr}, OE. \emph{hearg}, PNWGmc. \emph{*harugaʀ})
  A cairn constructed for ritual purposes. \emph{Hind} 10 describes one: “A \inx{harrow} he made for me, loaded with stones; now that stone-pile is become into glass. He reddened [it] in fresh blood of oxen; Oughthere ever trusted on the osennies.” See also \inx{wigh}.

\inxitem{leed}[C] (ON. \emph{ljóð}, OE. \emph{léod})
  A magical chant or incantation. See also \inx{galder}[C], \inx{gale}[C], \inx{begale}[C].

\inxitem{manwit}[C] (ON. \emph{manvit})
  Practical sense and wisdom, situational awareness, ‘common sense’.

\inxitem{orlay}[C] (ON. \emph{ørlǫg}, OE. \emph{orlæg})
  One’s predetermined fate, destiny, purpose as decreed by the \inx{Norns}.

\inxitem{rest}[C] (ON. \emph{rǫst})
  The distance between two rest-stops, a geographical mile (about 1850 metres). See especially \CV.

\inxitem{rune}[C] (ON. \emph{rún}, OE. \emph{rún}, OS. \emph{rúna}, OHG. \emph{rúna}, Got. \emph{rúna}, PNWGmc. \emph{rūnu})
  An (esoteric) secret message or formula. That this—rather than ‘letter (of a Runic alphabet)’—is the original and proper sense is apparent from among others the Finnish borrowing \emph{runo} ‘poem; poetry; a division of a poem (specifically the \emph{Kalevala})’, and its use in the singular in the earliest Runic inscriptions such as Noleby Vg 63 (which contains the linguistically indecipherable string of letters ᚢᚾᚨᚦᛟᚢᛊᚢᚺᚢᚱᚨᚺᛊᚢᛊᛁᚺ[--]ᚨᛁ\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{ᛏ}ᛁᚾ, a \emph{rune} in the proper sense) or the recently discovered Svingerud fragment. Thus, Weden’s taking of the \emph{runes} should not be interpreted as merely a myth for the invention of profane writing, but rather the origin of esoteric incantations, not at all unlike Indian \emph{mantras}.
  The word for letter was instead \inx{stave}[C], see also there.

\inxitem{soo}[C] (ON. \emph{sóa})
  To ritually waste, the slaying in the animal sacrifice.

\inxitem{thill}[C] (ON. \emph{þylja})
  To chant poetry or lists (so called \inx{thules}[C][thule]) acquired by rote memorization. See also {thyle}[C].

\inxitem{Thing}[C] (ON., OE. \emph{þing}, OS. \emph{thing}, OHG. \emph{ding})
  The legal assembly and gathering place where matters would be settled and the law recited.

\inxitem{thyle}[C] (ON. \emph{þulr}, OE. \emph{þyle}, PNWGmc. \emph{*þuliʀ})
  A sage who through rote learning has acquired a large amount of mythological lore (cf. \emph{þula} 'a list in poetic form; a meaningless poem' and \emph{þylja} 'to recite, to chant'). Thus \inx{Weden} is the \inx{Fimble-thyle}, being the unbeaten master of lore, as can be seen in his wisdom contests (see \Allvismal, \Vafthrudnismal). Runic inscription DR 248 (Snoldelev) suggests the thyle may have tied to a specific place, and in Beowulf it seems to have been a court position, with \inx{Unferth} being described as the "thyle of Rothgar".

\inxitem{wallow}[C] (ON. \emph{vǫlva}, OE. \emph{*wealwe} (cf. ON. \emph{svǫlva}, OE. \emph{swealwe} ‘swallow’))
  A sibyl, prophetess. The name derives from the \inx{wale}[C], the staff carried by them.

\inxitem{wigh}[C] (ON. \emph{vé}, OE. \emph{wéoh}, \emph{wíh}, PNWGmc. \emph{*wīhą})
  A holy shrine or sanctuary. It seems that where the \inx{harrow} was a pile of stones or cairn used for carrying out rituals, the \emph{wigh} was an enclosed space. The earliest Norse attestation is the runic inscription Ög N288 (Oklunda), which reads: “Guthhere <= Gunnarr> painted these runes, and he fled, guilty. Sought this wigh, and he fled into this clearing. And he bound. [...]” The implication seems to be that the wigh was considered so sacred that Guthhere could not be apprehended or punished for his crime while in it. — In Old English the word means ‘pagan idol’. It is not immediately clear which meaning is the original one, but in this edition the Norse sense has been adopted, since the Anglo-Saxon sources are all of a Christian nature. The \emph{Beewolf} name \emph{Wighstone} (\emph{Wīh-} or \emph{Wēohstān}) in any case suggests it is the Norse meaning, since ‘idol-stone’ makes little sense.

\inxitem{wode}[C] (ON. \emph{óðr}, OE. \emph{wód}, PNWGmc. \emph{*wōþuʀ})
  \inx{Hean}'s gift to men, though the name would suggest it be from \inx{Weden}. The word has several related meanings: ‘poetic inspiration’, ‘madness’, ‘rage’.

In the later Icelandic tradition this has been forgotten, and he is consistently portrayed as a heroic king.

  A king of the \inx{Shieldings} (see family tree), one of the main characters in \emph{Beewolf}.
