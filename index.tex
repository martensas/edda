\section{Cultural and religious terms and expressions (C)}
\begin{itemize}

\inxitem[C]{ape} (ON \emph{api}, OE \emph{apa}, OS \emph{apo}, OHG \emph{affo}, PNWGmc. \emph{*apó})
  In the Old Norse the word seems to mean ‘fool, buffoon’, in the other old languages apparently ‘monkey’, though this sense should be a later development of the former; why would the early Germanic tribes have a word for an animal that they had never encountered?

\inxitem[C]{aught} (ON \emph{ę́tt}, OE \emph{ǽht} ‘possession, property’)
  The Nordic (paternal) clan or family line.

\inxitem[C]{begale} (OHG \emph{bi-galan})
  To enchant, bewitch something or someone by singing a \inx[C]{galder}. Transitive of \inx[C]{gale}.

\inxitem[C]{bigh} (ON \emph{baugr}, OE \emph{béag}, OHG \emph{boug})
  Armlets used as currency during the Migration Period. — The giving of rings and armlets in exchange for loyalty (\inx[C]{holdness} being the word used for a warrior’s loyalty towards his lord, and of a lord’s grace towards his servants) was common across all of Germanic Europe, as seen in the many poetic ruler-kennings of the type “breaker of rings” (e.g. \emph{béaga brytta} ‘the breaker of bighs’ in \Beowulf\ ll. 35, 352, 1487). An illustrative example of this is \Hildebrandslied\ 33–35.
  This is also connected with the oath-ring, and the famous ring-swords. TODO? reference some literature on this.

\inxitem[C]{bloot} (ON \emph{blót}, OE \emph{blót}, OHG \emph{bluoz})
  A sacrifice or a sacrificial feast, one of the best attested Germanic pagan practices. The animals would be sacrificed by the host, cooked in large kettles and eaten communally. See also \inx[C]{bloot-house}.

\inxitem[C]{bloot-house} (ON \emph{blót-hús}, OHG \emph{bluoz-hús})
  A heathen temple. Glosses Latin \emph{fānum} in OHG. See also \inx[C]{harrow}, \inx[C]{hove}, \inx[C]{wigh}.

\inxitem[C]{Doom} (ON \emph{dómr}, OE \emph{dóm})
  Commonly ‘judgement, verdict’ (whence Doomsday, ‘Judgement Day’), in the Norse and Anglo-Saxon poetry often specifically referring to one’s fame or good reputation (that is, how others will judge one’s character and deeds), especially after death. It is clear that this verdict was of utmost importance to the ancient Germanic people. The clearest examples are \Havamal\ 77 (see there): \emph{I know one that never dies: the \textbf{Doom} o’er each man dead.} and \Beowulf\ 1384-1389, where Beewolf consols king Rothgar after Grendle’s mother has slain his trusted advisor Asher (\emph{Æschere}):
  \bvg\bva[] \emph{Ne sorga, snotor guma! \hld\ Sélre bið ǽghwǽm, //
  þæt hé his fréond wrece, \hld\ þonne hé fela murne. //
  Úre ǽghwylc sceal \hld\ ende gebídan //
  worolde lífes; \hld\ wyrce sé þe móte //
  \textbf{dómes} ǽr déaþe; \hld\ þæt bið drihtguman //
  unlifgendum \hld\ æfter sélest.}\eva
  \bvb ‘Sorrow not, wise man! ’Tis better for each one that he avenge his friend, than that he mourn much. Each one of us shall suffer the end of worldly life—win he who might \textbf{Doom} before death: that is for the warrior, unliving, afterwards the best.’\evb\evg
  Other illustrative examples in \Beowulf\ include 884b–887a: \emph{[...] Sigemunde gesprong // æfter déaðdæge \hld\ \textbf{dóm} unlýtel // syþðan wíges heard \hld\ wyrm ácwealde // hordes hyrde [...]} ‘For \inx[P]{Syemund} sprang up after his day of death an unlittle \ken*{= great} \textbf{Doom}, since hard in conflict he defeated the \inx[C]{Wyrm}, the herder of the hoard.’
  and 953b–955a: \emph{[...] þú þé self hafast // dę́dum gefremed \hld\ þæt þín \textbf{dóm} lyfað // áwa tó aldre [...]} ‘Thou hast for thyself by deeds accomplished that thy \textbf{Doom} lives for ever and ever.’

\inxitem[P]{feather-hame} (ON \emph{fjaðr-hamr}, OE \emph{feðer-hama}, OS \emph{feðar-}, \emph{feðer-hamo})
  A plumage, which when donned by the wearer lets him fly like, or perhaps become, a bird. One is owned by Frow and used by Lock to fly between the homes. In the \Heliand\ feather-hames are donned by angels who fly from heaven to earth. See also \inx[C]{hame}.

\inxitem[C]{fee} (ON \emph{fé}, OE \emph{féoh})
  Originally ‘cattle’, however also used in a broader sense to refer to one’s mobile wealth. For this cf. particularly \Havamal\ TODO.

\inxitem[C]{fey} (ON \emph{fęigr}, OE \emph{fǽge}, OHG \emph{feigi} ‘cowardly’)
  Being doomed or fated to die, with a sense of predestination and inevitability. Its earliest use is on the Rök stone: \textbf{aft uamuþ stąnta runaʀ þaʀ ᛭ n uarin faþi faþiʀ aft} faikiąn \textbf{sunu} \emph{Apt Vámóð standa rúnaʀ þáʀ, en Varinn fáði, faðir aft \textbf{fęigjan} sonu} ‘After Woemood (\emph{Vámóðr}) stand these \inx[C]{rune}[runes], but Warren (\emph{Varinn}) painted, the father after the \textbf{fey} son.’ It was believed that one’s TODO. See \textciteshorttitle{PCRN-HS} II:35, p. 928 ff. (TODO)

\inxitem[C]{feyness} (ON \emph{fęigð})
  The state of being \inx[C]{fey}.

\inxitem[C]{fimble-} (ON \emph{fimbul-})
  The ultimate, final, greatest. See \inx[P]{Fimblethyle}, \inx[L]{Fimble-winter}.

\inxitem[C]{five days} (ON \emph{fimm dagar})
  That the old Scandinavian week was \textbf{five days} long is well attested. According to the \Gulatingslog\ there were six weeks in a month, and the expression \textbf{five days} is used as the equivalent of \emph{week} in \Havamal\ 51 and 74, in the second of which it is contrasted with \emph{month}. Related to this is the legal term \emph{fifth} (ON \emph{fimmt}, OSw. \emph{fæmt}), a meeting or gathering set to be held at a five-day notice. See \emph{fimt} in \CV, \textcite{LMNL} for further discussion.

\inxitem[C]{galder} (ON \emph{galdr}, OE \emph{gealdor}, OHG \emph{galdar})
  A magical spell or song. See the Merseburg charms (TODO?) for examples. See also \inx[C]{gale}.

\inxitem[C]{gale} (ON \emph{gala}, OE \emph{galan}, OHG \emph{galan})
  To sing \inx[C]{galder}[galders].

\inxitem[C]{gand} (ON \emph{gandr}, Latin \emph{gandus})
  A witch’s familiar, a spirit sent out to do her bidding. See \textciteshorttitle{PCRN-HS} I:17, p. 361 and II:26, p. 656. TODO

\inxitem[C]{gid} (ON \emph{goði}, OE \emph{Gydda} masc. given name)
  A heathen priest or master of ceremonies.

\inxitem[C]{gidden} (ON \emph{gyðja}, OE \emph{gyden} ‘goddess’)
  The womanly equivalent of \inx[C]{gid}.

\inxitem[C]{good of meat} (ON \emph{matar góðr})
   An old expression, appearing both in \Havamal\ 39 and several Viking Age Runic inscriptions, viz. Sm 39: \emph{mildan orða \hld\ ok mataʀ góðan} ‘mild of words and \textbf{good of meat}’, U 805: \emph{bónda góðan matar} ‘a farmer \textbf{good of meat}’, U 703: \emph{mandr matar góðr \hld\ auk máls risinn} ‘a man \textbf{good of meat} and proud in speech™; cf. also U 739: \emph{hann vaʀ mildr mataʀ \hld\ auk máls risinn} ‘he was \textbf{mild of meat} and proud in speech’. — Antonyms are \emph{matar illr} ‘evil of meat’ and \inx[C]{meat-nithing}.

\inxitem[C]{guest} (ON \emph{gęstr}, OE \emph{giest}, OS \emph{gast}, OHG \emph{gast}, Got. \emph{gasts}, PGmc. \emph{gastiz})
  The Old Germanic peoples placed great value on hospitality.

\inxitem[C]{hame} (ON \emph{hamr})
  A skin, shape. Individuals can through magic “shift hames” (ON \emph{skipta hǫmum}), and leave their human \emph{hames} behind, instead entering into the shapes of wolves, bears, birds. During this process the original hame would be sleeping in a vulnerable state, as described in \VolsungaSaga\ ch. TODO-NUMBER: TODO-QUOTATION. See also \inx[C]{feather-hame}, \inx[C]{town-riders}, \inx[C]{evening-riders}.

\inxitem[C]{harrow} (ON \emph{hǫrgr}, OE \emph{hearg}, PNWGmc. \emph{*harugaʀ})
  A cairn constructed for ritual purposes. \Hyndluljod\ 10 describes one: “A \inx[C]{harrow} he made for me, loaded with stones; now that stone-pile is become into glass. He reddened [it] in fresh blood of oxen; \inx[P]{Oughter} ever trusted on the \inx[G]{Ossens}.” See also \inx[C]{wigh}.

\inxitem[C]{hold} (ON \emph{hollr}, OE \emph{hold}, OS \emph{hold}, OHG \emph{hold})
  %TODO Mention: unhold wights, Old Saxon baptismal formula.
  ‘Favourable, loyal, gracious’, often of a ruler towards his subject (in the sense of ‘gracious, benevolent’) or vice-versa (in the sense of ‘loyal, devoted’).  Mirroring these earthly relationships, it is often used to refer to divine grace, both of the Christian God—thus in the \emph{Ecclesiastical Laws of King Cnut} \textciteshorttitle[372]{ALIE1}: \emph{Þam byþ witod-líce God hold, þe bið his hláforde rihtlíce hold} ‘Indeed God is \textbf{hold} towards him who is rightly \textbf{hold} to his lord’—but in the oldest Scandinavian material likewise of the Heathen gods.
  Thus \Lokasenna\ 4 (e.): \emph{holl ręgin} ‘\textbf{hold} \inx[G]{Reins}’, and \Oddrunargratr\ 10 (e.): \\ \emph{Svá hjalpi þér \hld\ hollar véttir,} \\ ‘So help thee \textbf{hold} \inx[C]{wights}; \inx[P]{Frie} and \inx[P]{Frow}, and more gods [...]’. %TODO: Numbering of Oddrunargratr is very uncertain.

  This word is common in old Scandinavian oath formulæ, e.g. in the elder redaction of the West-Geatish Law: \emph{Svá sé mér goð holl} ‘So may the Gods(!) be \textbf{hold} towards me,’ in medieval Norwegian laws (\textciteshorttitle{NGL2}[197,397]) and Grey-Goose (TODO: cite): \emph{Guð sé mér hollr ef ek satt segi, gramr ef ek lýg} ‘God be \textbf{hold} towards me if I speak truly, wroth if I lie,’ in Grey-Goose (TODO) also: \emph{Sé guð hollr þeim er heldr griðum, en gramr þeim er grið rýfr} ‘God be \textbf{hold} towards him who keeps the truce, but wroth against him who breaks the truce’. I refer to \textcite{Läffler1895} for further discussion on these formulæ.

\inxitem[C]{holdness} (ON \emph{hylli}, OE \emph{hyldu}, OHG \emph{huldí})
  Abstract noun formed to \inx[C]{hold}, meaning ‘favour, loyalty, grace,’ with the same semantics as the adjective.

  Notably, this word appears three times in connection with the grace of gods in the poetry, namely in \Grimnismal\ 43, where (according to my interpretation) the preparer of food at the bloot is said to earn the “\textbf{holdness} of \inx[P]{Woulder} and of all the gods;” and \Grimnismal\ 53 where the disgraced king Garfrith is said to have been bereft of the support \emph{gęngi} of Weden and all the Oneharriers, and of “Weden’s \textbf{holdness}” (\emph{Óðins hylli}).  “Weden’s holdness” is also mentioned in a stanza by Hallfred (edited as Hfr Lv 7 by Diana Whaley in \Skp\ V), who laments that: “The whole race of man has wrought songs to win the \textbf{holdness} of Weden; I recall the fully rewarded works of our kinsmen/ancestors.”

  From the semantics of this word the Germanic view on heavenly grace is clear: the Gods are \textbf{hold} towards those who do good works, which include swearing true oaths, faithfully observing truces, partaking in the bloot, following rules of hospitality, and composing poetry—and \inx[C]{gram} ‘wroth’ towards those who do the opposite.

\inxitem[C]{Home} (ON \emph{hęimr}, OE \emph{hám}, PNWGmc. \emph{*haimaʀ})
  In the Norse often referring to a realm in the cosmology (\Voluspa\ 2: “I remember nine \textbf{Homes}”, \Vafthrudnismal\ TODO: “From the runes of the \inx[G]{Ettins} and of all the gods I can speak truly, for I have come into each \textbf{Home}”). Thus \inx[L]{Ettinham} is the ‘\textbf{Home}/realm of the ettins’. When used alone the term simply means ‘the world (that we inhabit)’. See also \inx[L]{nine Homes}, \inx[L]{Thrithham}.

\inxitem[C]{leat} (ON \emph{hlaut})
  Sacrificial blood (that is, taken from the animal), originally certainly referring to its use in auguries, as seen by the root.

\inxitem[C]{leat-twig} (ON \emph{hlaut-tęinn})
  A twig used to sprinkle the \inx[C]{leat} in auguries (presumably the pattern of the blood would then be inspected).

\inxitem[C]{leed} (ON \emph{ljóð}, OE \emph{léod})
  A magical chant or incantation, as seen by \Havamal\ 153 synonymous with \inx[C]{galder}. See also \inx[C]{gale}, \inx[C]{begale}.

\inxitem[C]{manwit} (ON \emph{man-vit})
  Practical/common sense and wisdom, situational awareness.

\inxitem[C]{many-cunning} (ON \emph{fjǫl-kunnigr})
  i.e. ‘skilled with sorcery’.

\inxitem[C]{meat-nithing} (ON \emph{mat-níðingr})
  One who is a \inx[C]{nithing} with food, i.e. one who does not properly furnish his \inx[C]{guest}[guest]. See \inx[C]{good of meat}.

\inxitem[C]{nithe} (ON \emph{níð}, OE \emph{níþ}, OHG \emph{níd})
  Originally ‘hatred, emnity’. In the Norse the sense is something like ‘shame’, which was thought to be not just social, but rather almost physical. Thus a curser could “turn nithe” (\emph{snýja níð} against his enemy and cause him great misfortune; a poet would “compose nithe” (\emph{yrkja níð}) through singing slanderous verses, which likewise had a supernatural adverse effect on their subject. See also \inx[C]{nithing}.

\inxitem[C]{nithing} (ON \emph{níðingr}, OE \emph{níþing})
  One afflicted with \inx[C]{nithe}; a villain. In the Norse a sort of legal term; a nithing could not swear oaths or bear witness.

\inxitem[C]{orlay} (ON \emph{ørlǫg}, OE \emph{orlæg})
  One’s predetermined fate, destiny, purpose as decreed by the \inx[G]{Norns}.

\inxitem[C]{rest} (ON \emph{rǫst})
  The distance between two rest-stops, a geographical mile (about 1850 metres). See \CV: \emph{rǫst}.

\inxitem[C]{rune} (ON \emph{rún}, OE \emph{rún}, OS \emph{rúna}, OHG \emph{rúna}, Got. \emph{rúna}, PNWGmc. \emph{rūnu})
  An (esoteric) secret message or formula. That this—rather than ‘letter (of a Runic alphabet)’—is the original and proper sense is apparent from among others the Finnish borrowing \emph{runo} ‘poem; poetry; a division of a poem (specifically of the \emph{Kalevala})’, and its use in the singular in the earliest Runic inscriptions (e.g. Noleby Vg 63, which contains the linguistically indecipherable string of letters {ᚢᚾᚨᚦᛟᚢᛊᚢᚺᚢᚱᚨᚺᛊᚢᛊᛁᚺ[--]ᚨᛁ\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{ᛏ}ᛁᚾ}, a \emph{rune} in the proper sense or the recently discovered Svingerud fragment.) Thus, Weden’s taking of the \emph{runes} should not be interpreted as merely a myth for the invention of profane writing, but rather the origin of esoteric incantations, not at all unlike Indian \emph{mantras}.
  The word for letter was instead \inx[C]{stave}, see also there.

\inxitem[C]{scold} (ON \emph{skald})
  A Scandinavian poet. The name probably comes from their ability to slander with words.

\inxitem[C]{simble} (ON \emph{sumbl}, OE \emph{symbol})
  A banquet.

\inxitem[C]{soo} (ON \emph{sóa})
  To ritually waste, to slay (especially in a sacrificial context).

\inxitem[C]{thill} (ON \emph{þylja})
  To chant poetry or lists (so called \inx[C]{thule}[thules]) acquired by rote memorization. See \inx[C]{thyle}.

\inxitem[C]{Thing} (ON, OE \emph{þing}, OS \emph{thing}, OHG \emph{ding})
  A (legal) assembly, where lawsuits would be settled and the law fastened. The \inx[G]{Gods} also hold a Thing, see \inx[G]{All Gods}.

\inxitem[C]{thule} (ON \emph{þula})
  A poetic list, typically of various items of a category (e.g. gods, legendary horses) or poetic synonyms (e.g. for swords, men, Weden). Degoratively also a ditty, poorly composed poem. See \inx[C]{thyle}.

\inxitem[C]{thyle} (ON \emph{þulr}, OE \emph{þyle}, PNWGmc. \emph{*þuliʀ})
  A sage who through rote learning has acquired a large amount of mythological lore (cf. \inx[C]{thule} ‘a list in poetic form; a ditty, bad poem’ and \inx[C]{thill} ‘to recite, to chant’). Thus \inx[P]{Weden} is the \inx[P]{Fimblethyle}, being the unbeaten master of lore, as can be seen in his wisdom contests (like \Vafthrudnismal). Runic inscription DR 248 (Snoldelev) suggests the thyle may have tied to a specific place, and in \Beowulf\ it seems to have been a court position, with the poet Unferth being described (l. 1456) as the “thyle of Rothgar”.

\inxitem[C]{wale} (ON \emph{vǫlr})
  The staff or sceptre, especially of a wallow. TODO: archeological finds, mention Sutton Hoo.

\inxitem[C]{wallow} (ON \emph{vǫlva}, OE \emph{*wealwe} (cf. ON \emph{svǫlva}, OE \emph{swealwe} ‘swallow’))
  A sibyl, seeress, oracle. The word derives from the \inx[C]{wale}, a staff or sceptre probably used for ritual purposes.

\inxitem[C]{wigh} (ON \emph{vé}, OE \emph{wéoh}, \emph{wíh}, PNWGmc. \emph{*wīhą})
  A holy shrine or sanctuary. It seems that where the \inx[C]{harrow} was a pile of stones or cairn used for carrying out rituals, the \textbf{wigh} was an enclosed space. The earliest Norse attestation is the runic inscription Ög N288 (Oklunda), which reads: “Guther <= Gunnarr> painted these runes, and he fled, guilty. Sought this wigh, and he fled into this clearing. And he bound. [...]” The implication seems to be that the wigh was considered so sacred that Guther could not be apprehended or punished for his crime while in it. — In OE the word means ‘pagan idol’. It is not immediately clear which meaning is the original one, but in the present edition the Norse sense has been adopted, since the Anglo-Saxon sources are all of a Christian nature. The \Beowulf\ name \emph{Wighstone} (\emph{Wīh-} or \emph{Wēohstān}) in any case suggests it is the Norse meaning, since ‘idol-stone’ makes little sense.

\inxitem[C]{wode} (ON \emph{óðr}, OE \emph{wód}, PNWGmc. \emph{*wóduʀ})
  \inx[P]{Heener}’s gift to men, though the name may suggest it be from \inx[P]{Weden}. The word has several related meanings: ‘mind, (poetic) inspiration, rage’. See also \inx[P]{Woderearer}.

\inxitem[C]{yin-} (ON \emph{ginn-})
  A rare augmentative prefix. TODO.

\inxitem[C]{yin-holy} (ON \emph{ginn-hęilagr})
  High holy, sacrosanct. Used of the Gods in the formula \emph{ginn-hęilǫg goð} ‘yin-holy Gods’.

\end{itemize}

As foreshadowed in \Beowulf\ 1017–9, 1180–90, he betrays the sons of \inx[P]{Rothgar}, his cousins \inx[P]{Rethrich and Rothmund}, in order to take the throne for himself. In the later Icelandic tradition this has been forgotten, and he is consistently portrayed as a heroic king.

  A king of the \inx[G]{Shieldings} (see family tree), one of the main characters in \Beowulf.

  In the Norse tradition the son of \inx[C]{Walsing} and father of \inx[P]{Siward}, the slayer of the \inx[C]{wyrm} \inx[P]{Fathomer}. In \Beowulf\ it is instead he himself who together with his nephew \inx[P]{Sinfittle} slays an unnamed wyrm.

\inxitem[P]{Siward} (ON \emph{Sigurðr})
  A hero of the \inx[G]{Walsings}, in \Beowulf\ attested as the slayer of the dragon along with his nephew \inx[P]{Sinfittle}. In the Norse tradition however, it is his half-brother \inx[P]{Siward} that slays the dragon instead.

  Son of \inx[P]{Weden} and \inx[P]{Earth}.

\inxitem[P]{Tew} (ON \emph{Týr}, OE \emph{Tíw})

\inxitem[P]{Webthrithner} (ON \emph{Vafþrúðnir})
  The ettin defeated by Weden in the wisdom contest in \Vafthrudnismal.

\inxitem[P]{Weden} (rhymes with \emph{leaden}; ON \emph{Óðinn}, OE \emph{Wóden}, \emph{Wéden}, OHG \emph{Wuotan}, PNWGmc. \emph{*Wódanaʀ})
  Chief of the \inx[G]{Eese}, his name is clearly related to \inx[C]{wode}, referring to his role as the patron of \inx[C]{scold}[scolds] and \inx[C]{bearserk}[bearserks].

\inxitem[P]{Woulder} (ON \emph{Ullr}, \emph{*Wuldor}, PNWGmc. \emph{*Wulþuz})
  A rather obscure god. He is mentioned in connection with oath-rings (TODO) and the setting of ritual fires (\Grimnismal\ TODO). These obscure references are likely related to the interesting finds at Lilla Ullevi (‘the small \inx[C]{wigh} of Woulder’) in Upland, Sweden, consisting of several dozen fire striker-shaped iron amulet rings dating to 660–780 (for a detailed description see \parencite{afEdholm2009}).

\inxitem[P]{Yimer} (ON \emph{Ymir}, OE \emph{*Yime})

\inxitem[G]{Danes} (ON \emph{danir}, OE \emph{dene}, PNWGmc. \emph{*daníʀ})
  A tribe in eastern modern-day Denmark and southern Sweden. They probably originated in Scania in southern Sweden, before moving westwards into the Danish isles and eventually Jutland, driving out the \inx[G]{Earls} and \inx[G]{Jutes}.

\inxitem[G]{Nears} (ON \emph{níarar} \char`~ \emph{njárar})
  A Swedish tribe, only mentioned in \Volundarkvida, where it is ruled by king \inx[P]{Nithad}. The name and location may allow us to connect them with the Swedish province of Närke, cf. Old Swedish: \emph{Nærikiar} ‘inhabitants of Närke’, \emph{Nærisker} ‘belonging to Närke; Nearish’, in which case the Old Swedish stem \emph{nær-} (with unclear vowel length, though it is probably long) would be a reduced form of \emph{níar-}, \emph{njár-}.
