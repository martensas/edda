\section{Germanic alliterative poetry}

  \subsection{Historical significance}

  The historical-literary significance of the Old Germanic poetry is twofold. On the one hand it forms the oldest extensive monuments in its respective languages, and indeed the earliest indigenous Germanic literature (the Gothic being wholly derivative and translational).  It lays the ground for the \emph{Nibelungenlied} and Chaucer, who in turn precede such famous writers as Shakespeare and Wagner.  It forms the first and most important source of our knowledge about the ancient folk-life of Northern Europe.

  Oon the other hand it is by no means an innovative or newly created genre. Already, and perhaps especially, in our oldest sources the language is rich with expressions and images, many of great antiquity: "sea-stallions" sail across the ocean; the sun is drawn across Heaven in her chariot; feasts are held in great chiefly halls. These motifs are very ancient—they are found in the archeology of the Nordic Bronze Age and in the lines of \Rigveda\ and Homer.

  The language likewise overflows with archaic poetic synonyms.  Indo-European words otherwise extinct in all Germanic languages find their last refuge in the alliterative poetry.  Such are the Old English \emph{eoh}, Old Norse \emph{jór}, corresponding to the Sanskrit \emph{áşva}, Latin \emph{equus}, all meaning ‘horse’; Old Norse \emph{týr}, corresponding to Sanskrit \emph{devá}, Latin \emph{deus}, all meaning ‘god’; Old English and Old Norse \emph{fold} 'earth, land', corresponding to Sanskrit \emph{pṛthivī́} 'id.'  The fact that many of these relate to the cult also suggests that the Germanic religion was not as innovative as is commonly supposed.

  The organizing poetic principle of alliteration must also have been in effect for some time. Even the earliest \emph{scalds} and \emph{scops} have dozens of synonyms for words like man, sword, horse, and hall. Needless to say, many of them—like \emph{jór} above—are very old, and only found in poetry.

  \subsection{Meter(s)}
    The Old Germanic poetry has two primary structural elements: \emph{stress} and \emph{alliteration}.  The exact count of syllables is less important, and end-rhyme is only used as a sporadic flourish.

    \subsubsection{Stress}
    When scanning alliterative meter each syllable is generally classed as having either primary stress (p), secondary stress (s), or no stress (x).

    Primary stress is reserved for the root syllable in a word, which is not always the same as the first syllable.  Compare the English word \emph{beginning}, where the stress pattern is xPx; the primary stress falls on the syllable \emph{ginn-}.

    Secondary stress falls on the second element in a compound word.

    Not all words have the same stress; the general rule is that nouns and adjectives have stronger stress than verbs, which in turn have stronger stress than prepositions and pronouns.  Where exceptions occur this coincides with semantic stress, e.g. in a statement like “It was \emph{you}!”

    \subsubsection{Alliteration}
    The following rules describe Germanic alliteration:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Alliteration is the resonance between two stressed syllables beginning with the same “sound”, e.g. \emph{\alst{s}and} with \emph{re\alst{c}eive}, or \emph{\alst{g}reat} with \emph{be\alst{g}in}.
      \item Any vowel or diphthong can alliterate with any other vowel or dipththong.
      \item \emph{s} and the clusters \emph{sk, sp} and \emph{st} are counted as four distinct “sounds”.
    \end{enumerate}

    Further, in West Germanic poetry,

    \begin{enumerate}[4.]
      \item \emph{g} and \emph{j} are treated as the same sound.
    \end{enumerate}

    In the present edition alliterating sounds are marked with red font.

    \subsubsection{Lines}
    Most alliterative poetry is written in the same common meter, which in Old Icelandic poetics gets the name \emph{fornyrðislag} ‘measure of ancient words’.  The smallest metrical division is the \emph{position}, a concept related but not identical to the syllable.  For instance, two short syllables (that is, one where a short vowel is followed by a single consonant) can \emph{resolve} into a single position.

    Four positions—two stressed, two unstressed—make up the normal \emph{half-line} or \emph{verse}.  Two half-lines separated by a short break or \emph{cæsura} (here represented by the interpunct “·”) form a couplet or \emph{long-line}.  The first half-line (or \emph{a-verse}) may have either one or two alliterations on the stressed positions, with preference for the first position over the second.  The second half-line (or \emph{b-verse}) must always have an alliteration on its first stressed position; never on its second.

    In the present edition each long-line is printed on a new line.  This is already standard for the publication of West Germanic poetry, whereas many editions of Scandinavian poetry print each half-line.

    \subsubsection{Fits and stanzas}
    Bigger structures are \emph{fits} and \emph{stanzas}.  The former are found in the Old Saxon and English traditions, the latter only in the Scandinavian.

    A \emph{fit} is a section or canto in a longer epic poem.  It does not have a fixed length, but is generally around 70-85 lines long.  Thus the 3182-line \Beowulf\ is divided into 44 fits (for an average of 72 lines per fit); the surviving 5983 lines of \Heliand\ are divided into 71 (for an average of 84 lines per fit).  It is probably not a coincidence that the length of the fit is similar to the length of shorter legendary poems like \GudrunOne\ or \Hildebrandslied.  In \Heliand\ a new fit can begin in the cæsura; this does not happen in \Beowulf.

    In Scandinavian poetry a \emph{stanza} is a group of long-lines, typically (but far from always) four.  The regularity of stanza-length varies from poem to poem.

\section{The present corpus}
  The scope of the present corpus is large, and encompasses most of the alliterative poetry extant in Old Germanic languages.  The poetry is divided into the following categories:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Norse Mythic poetry}, i.e., that which directly treats the Germanic mythology.  This category is exclusively Norse for the simple reason that no West Germanic or Gothic mythic narrative poetry survive.
    \item \textbf{Norse Heroic poetry}, specifically the whole second half of the Codex Regius and then a few other works.  With a few exceptions, subject matter outside of the Walsing cycle is not included.
    \item \textbf{West Germanic Heroic Poetry} in Old English, Old Saxon, and Old High German.
    \item \textbf{Poetry on Christian subjects}.  This category includes explicitly Christian poems where the new religion or its mythology is at the core of the work.  Christian heroic poems depicting native legends, like \Beowulf\ and \Hildebrandslied, are not included.
    \item \textbf{Galders}, i.e., alliterative spells and charms, both from runic inscriptions and medieval manuscripts.
    \item \textbf{Miscellaneous runic poetry}, apart from that already edited under Galders above.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Exclusions}
    All Norse Scaldic poetry is excluded, as is the Eddic poetry found in the saws of Icelanders and of ancient ages (\emph{forn-aldar-sǫgur}) which does not directly relate to the Walsing cycle.  These two categories have already been admirably rendered in the \Skp\ series.  It would also require a somewhat different approach in terms of how it is presented, since the underlying poetry is often impossible to take out of its prose context.  Further, when it comes to the Eddic poetry it is sometimes doubtful whether it ever existed on its own, or has belonged with prose from the start.  Basically, I think it would be more conscientious to edit the whole saws as \emph{prosimetra}, an undertaking which naturally falls outside of the scope of the present edition.

  \subsection{Manuscripts}

    See the introduction to each category.

    \subsubsection{Old English poetry}

    The edited Old English poetry primarily derives from a few manuscripts.  Particularly important are the Exeter Book and \Lacnunga.

    \subsubsection{Old Saxon and High German poetry}

    There are no collections of alliterative poetry in these languages; instead the manuscript situation will be disussed in the Introduction to each individual text.


\section{The present edition}

  The present edition is divided into two equally large parts, presented side by side.  Each stanza or group of verse lines is presented first in the original Old Germanic language, and then in English translation.

  \subsection{The Old Germanic text}

    In the present edition are found texts in four Old Germanic languages: Old Norse, Old English, Old Saxon, and Old High German.  All texts have been normalized according to my own standardised orthography for the respective languages. The orthographies are all designed to follow three core principles:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A faithfulness to the spoken language at the time when the texts were written, and the distinctions demonstrably found therein.
      \item A respect for the etymological origin of words, and their distinctions.
      \item A striving for a uniform orthography across the various languages, so that the same etymological sound should be written with the same character.
    \end{enumerate}

    These choices often stand in conflict with the orthography of the original manuscripts and with most earlier philological tradition, whence there is some reason to justify them.  My goal is to render the texts themselves in a manner that gives as much philological information to the reader as possible—not to present a facsimile edition for students of paleography.  This follows the philological methods used for printing e.g. the \Rigveda, which is generally printed in an entirely scholarly latinized orthography, not the original \emph{Devanāgarī}.  Regardless, such important traits of the original manuscript tradition as the long \emph{ſ}, arbitrary punctuation, arbitrary spelling, and lack of line breaks, are seldom reproduced in modern editions of Old Germanic poetry.

    \subsubsection{General orthographic conventions}

    The following orthographic conventions are followed for all Old Germanic languages:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The voiceless dental fricative is always written with the letter \emph{þ}, never \emph{th}.
    \item Long vowels are marked with the acute accent, never the macron or circumflex, excepting
    \item those which have their origin in earlier dipththongs, which are written with the circumflex.
    \item In compounds where the first element has primary stress the elements are separated with a dash,
    \item but where the first element is a preposition they are separated with an interpunct.
    \end{enumerate}

    Below follow specifications for each specific language.

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old Norse}

    My Old Norse orthography is inspired by \textcite{FinnurEdda} in that it strives for a more archaic form than that of the surviving mss.; a form that instead represents the poetry as it may (in many cases, must) originally have looked. For this reason, it often has more in common with the proposed orthography of the First Grammatical Treatise than with the standard Old Icelandic orthography seen in most editions. The following list describes the differences from the standard Old Icelandic orthography:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item I distinguish short \emph{e} (from etymological short \emph{e}) and short \emph{ę} (from etymological short \emph{a} + \emph{i}-umlaut).
    \item I distinguish long \emph{á} and \emph{ǫ́}, as done by the First Grammatical Treatise.
    \item I use \emph{ǿ} and \emph{ę́} rather than the traditional \emph{œ} and \emph{æ}, to represent the vowels descended from Proto-Norse \emph{ō} and \emph{ā} after \emph{i}-umlaut (cf. the short \emph{ø, ę} < \emph{o, a} + \emph{i}-umlaut).
    \item I distinguish long nasal vowels \emph{ȧ, ė, ï, ȯ, u̇} from long oral \emph{á, é, í, ó, ú}, as done in the First Grammatical Treatise.
    \item I restore the old \emph{s}—which in modern Scandinavian and even in most Old Norse manuscripts has become \emph{r}, but which is found consistently in old manuscripts such as AM 237 a fol (c. 1150), and fossilized in forms like \emph{þaz} (i.e. \emph{þat’s}) in \Regius—in the words \emph{es} ‘which, that, where, when’, and in inflections of \emph{vesa} (later \emph{vera}) such as \emph{es} ‘is’ (3rd sg. pres. ind.) and \emph{vas} (3rd sg. pret. ind.). The following forms retain the \emph{r}, as it is there the result of Verner’s law, and not of this (much younger) sound change: the pl. pres. ind. (\emph{erum} etc.), the pl. pret. ind. (\emph{vǫ́rum} etc.), and the pl. pret. subj. (\emph{vę́rim} etc.)
    \item When metrically benefactory, I contract \emph{ek} ‘I’, \emph{eru} ‘are’, and \emph{es} ‘which; is’ to \emph{’k}, \emph{’ru} and \emph{’s}, respectively.
    \item I use \textcite{FinnurEdda}’s way of distinguishing between the relative particle \emph{es} and the verb \emph{es}: the first is appended to the previous word with only an apostrophe (e.g. \emph{hann’s} ‘he who’), while the second is separated by a space (e.g. \emph{hann ’s} ‘he is’).
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old Swedish and Danish}
    I employ the same conventions as those described for Old Norse above, including the marking of \emph{u}-mutated \emph{a} > \emph{ǫ} (that this was indeed found in the Eastern Nordic dialects is most clearly seen by the third-person personal pronoun, which shows \emph{u}-mutation in such forms as Swedish \emph{honom} ‘him’ < \emph{hǫ́num}, \emph{hon} ‘she’ < \emph{hǫ́n}).

    According to rule 3 in the general orthographic conventions above, I distinguish between \emph{ǿ} (< \emph{ǿ}) and \emph{ø̂} (< \emph{au, ęy}); \emph{é} (< \emph{é}) and \emph{ê} (< \emph{ęi}).

    Where unstressed vowels have been reduced into an schwa-like sound spelled \emph{e}, this is written with \emph{ę}.

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old English}
    I spell fronted or brightened etymological \emph{a} and \emph{á} with \emph{æ} and \emph{ǽ}, for instance in \emph{dæg} ‘day’ (< \emph{*dagaʀ}) and \emph{rǽd} ‘advice, counsel’ (< \emph{rádaʀ}).  These are contrasted with \emph{ę} and \emph{ę́}, which represent \emph{i}-mutated \emph{a} and \emph{á}, e.g. in \emph{ęllen} ‘zeal, courage’ (< \emph{*aljaną}).

    An assimilated \emph{n} is marked with an overpoint, like in rule 3 of Old Norse above.

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old Saxon}

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old High German}

  \subsection{The English translation}

    There is now a very large number of translations of the most popular alliterative poetic texts, namely \Beowulf\ and the \emph{Poetic Edda}.  These generally fall into two camps:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \emph{poetic} translations, which distort the precise meaning of the text for the sake of meter, often quite radically; and
      \item \emph{prose} translations, which nowise preserve the style or feeling of the original.
    \end{enumerate}

    Almost all translations, of both types, also tend toward the following inadequacies: obscuring or glossing over difficult technical and cultural terminology; rendering identically repeated phrases and words (formulae) differently at various places; and simplifying or rewriting kennings and other poetic expressions.  Even worse this is often done with little in the way of notes or commentary, to a point where the reader is sometimes left entirely oblivious to the sense of the original text.

    What sets my translation apart from previous English translations is that it aims to follow the style and register of the original text, without sacrificing the literal sense of the words.  This unfortunately means that literality and consistency at times must sometimes come at the cost of fluid idiomatic English, but it has the advantage of giving the reader an image of not just \emph{what} the original text actually says, but \emph{how} it says it.  The reader should keep in mind that he is in a very foreign land, that he is reading words ancient and long forgotten—not the \emph{New York Times}.

    Maybe this is a pointless effort? One could argue that a translation always is a betrayal, and that those truly interested in the exact meaning of every word in the original text should study just the original (in the original language).  While I do agree that the sufficiently interested reader should study the original texts in the languages in which they were written (something made much easier by the present edition with its notes and parallel edition), it is still a “hard ask” for those readers who are not philologically inclined, but instead students and scholars of history, comparative mythology and religion, anthropology, or literature; those who, for whatever reason, are interested in exploring the oldest poetic heritage of the Germanic peoples of northern Europe.

    \subsection{Anglish proper nouns}
      Perhaps the single most idiosyncratic part of the present translation will be its handling of proper nouns. I have opted to render all cultural and religious terms, names of places, heroes, gods, and other entities by their English cognates (thus \emph{Thunder} for Old Norse \emph{Þórr}) and where such do not exist, their philologically expected English (\emph{Anglish}) forms (e.g. \emph{wallow} for Old Norse \emph{vǫlva}).

      There are two reasons for this.  The first is ideological.  I believe that the Old Germanic myths and poems, their gods and heroes, are a shared heritage of Northern Europe.  When you translate texts from across Germany, England and Scandinavia you quickly come to notice how similar the diction is, how many names reappear. The Scandinavian \emph{Vǫlundr} is the same character as the English \emph{Wélund}; likewise Norse \emph{Óðinn} is the same as English \emph{Wóden}.  These are ultimately mere distinctions in pronunciation.

      The second is aesthetic.  Commonly accepted forms like \emph{Odin} and \emph{Thor} are debased.  They do not even represent the Old Norse pronunciation as accurately as possible within the constraints of English ortography (for instance, \emph{Odin} would be better anglicized as \emph{Othin}).  Many are also difficult for English speakers to pronounce, or lead to absurd confusions.  I shudder at hearing the word \emph{ę́sir} pronounced /aɪˈsɪ:ɹ/; even worse is when \emph{Ǫ́s-garðr} becomes “ass-guard”.
