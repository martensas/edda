\section{Notes to English translation}
  Point about literal translation for use by scholars of comparative mythology
    The “guiding star” of this translation effort has been literality and consistency. All previous translations (to my knowledge) have such issues as: rendering identically repeated phrases differently at various places; covering up or obscuring technical and cultural terminology; simplifying kennings and other expressions—and this often without notes, to a point where the original meaning is, at times, unrecognizable.
    While I wholly encourage all readers of sufficient interest to study Old Norse (and other ancient Germanic languages!), perhaps even using this edition as a tool, I also realize that this is a demanding ask which not all interested students and scholars of comparative mythology, anthropology, literature, religion and other fields will be able to fulfill. I therefore want these groups to be able to have a text that is as close to the original as possible, at the very least when it regards sense and expression.
  \subsection{Anglish proper nouns}
    One of the most idiosyncratic parts of this edition will be its handling of proper nouns. I have opted to render all cultural and religious terms, names of places, heroes, gods, and other entities by their English cognates (thus \emph{Thunder} for Old Norse \emph{Þórr}) and where such do not exist, their philologically expected English (\emph{Anglish}) forms (e.g. \emph{wallow} for Old Norse \emph{vǫlva}).
    One reason for this is ideological. I believe that these myths and poems are a common Germanic or Northern European heritage, and should be treated as such. The English once knew gods such as Weden and Thunder, and called them by names naturally evolved in their language. So too did the Germans and Scandinavians, of course, and I would hope that any translators into those languages would follow this spirit and render the names in their natural forms there as well.\footnote{For instance in German perhaps Wuten, Donner, Froh, in Swedish Oden, Tor, Frö.}
    Another is philological. Forms like Odin and Thor are, while now commonly accepted, debased. They do not even represent the Old Norse pronunciation as accurate as would be possible (for instance, Odin would be better anglicized as Othin; the dental fricative still survives in English!), and many are difficult for English speakers to pronounce. I shudder when hearing a word like \emph{ę́sir} pronounced \textipa{/"si:@(ɹ/}

\section{Notes to critical edition}
  My goal with the critical editing of the texts has been to produce something as close to the original mss. as possible, without excessive emendation to the preserved recension(s). There are texts in three (TODO) languages in this edition, these being Old Norse, Old English and Old High German. Old Norse texts have been normalized according to roughly the same orthography as \textcite{FinnurEdda}. On the other hand the Old High German and Old English texts have only been lightly normalized, correcting obvious errors and marking vowel length with acute accents. For further information see below.

  \subsection{Normalization}
    My general goal in normalizing texts has been to strive for a uniform orthography, where the same sound is written with the same character. This of course means disregarding local manuscript traditions and philological tradition, but I see this as justified. My goal is to render the texts themselves in a manner that gives as much information as possible; not to present a facsimile edition for students of paleography. Anyway, such aspects as the long \emph{ſ}, arbitrary punctuation and spelling variants, and lack of line breaks are never reproduced in modern editions of poetry.

    In practice this means that the acute accent is used in marking long vowels. %TODO.

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old Norse}
    The orthography is inspired by \textcite{FinnurEdda} in that it strives for a more archaic form than the mss., one that accords with the date at which the poetry may been composed. Because of this, it has more in common with that of the First Grammatical Treatise (see \parencite{FGTHaugen}) than with the standard Old Icelandic orthography seen in most editions. Thus I make use of \emph{ǿ} and \emph{ę́} rather than the traditional \emph{œ} and \emph{æ}, to represent the vowels descended from Proto-Norse \emph{ō} and \emph{ā} after i-umlaut (cf. the short \emph{ø, ę} < \emph{o, a} + i-umlaut).
    \emph{á} and \emph{ǫ́} are kept separate based on etymology.
    The old \emph{s}—which is found even in manuscripts such as AM 237 a fol (c. 1150) and was used by Snorre as late as the 1200s but later becomes \emph{r}—is retained in the words \emph{es} ‘which, that, where, when’, \emph{es} ‘is’ (3rd sg. pres. ind. of \emph{vesa} ‘to be’), \emph{vesa} ‘to be’, and inflections of it such as \emph{vas} (3rd sg. pret. ind.). Note that the pl. pres. ind. (\emph{erum} \&c.), pl. pret. ind. (\emph{vǫ́rum} \&c.) and pl. pret. subj. ((\emph{vę́rim} \&c.) forms of \emph{vesa} retain their \emph{r}, as it is caused by an ancient alternation termed Verner’s law, and not the result of this much younger sound change.
    Superfluous and hypermetrical pronouns (usually \emph{ek}, \emph{hann}, \emph{hǫ́n}) have in many places been removed.
    When metrically beneficient I have contracted \emph{ek} ‘I’, \emph{eru} ‘are’ and \emph{es} ‘which \&c.’, \emph{es} ‘is’ to \emph{’k}, \emph{’ru} and \emph{’s}. I follow \textcite{FinnurEdda}’s method of distinguishing between the relative particle \emph{es} and verb form \emph{es}; the first is directly appended to the previous word, whereas the second has a space before it. Thus \emph{hann’s} ‘he who, that’ but \emph{hann ’s} ‘he is’.

  \subsection{Manuscripts}

    \subsubsection{Eddic poetry}
    There are two surviving ancient mss. which contain full Eddic poems.

    The first and most important is GKS 2365 4to, here \Regius. It dates to the 1270s and has 45 surviving leaves, containing TODO poems. Of these 10 are mythological, and the rest heroic, dealing with legends mostly of the Migration Period. Notably, following fol. 32, there is a large gap of missing pages. This occurs in the heroic section, specifically cutting off \Sigrdrifumal. It is unclear how many leaves and poems went missing.
    \Regius\ is not just a compilation of poems, it shows editorial input as well. Several of the mythological poems are separated by short prose sections, which tie them together into a loose frame narrative, though it is clear from their style and composition that they are originally separate works. When it comes to the heroic poems long prose sections occur both within and between them, creating a \inx[C]{saw}-like narrative where the prose in many cases holds up the poetry, rather than the reverse. For further literature see TODO.

    The second manuscript is AM 748 I a 4to, here \AM. It dates to the 1300s and is not complete, consisting only of 6 leaves. It contains only mythological poems, and in a different order from \Regius; it notably has no frame narrative. On the first two leaves are contained the final verses of \Harbardsljod, the complete \Baldrsdraumar\, and the first verses of \Skirnismal\. After this some number of leaves have gone missing, but the other four leaves follow eachother. On them we find around half of \Vafthrudnismal\, \Grimnismal\, \Hymiskvida\ and the beginning of the prose introduction to \Volundarkvida. \AM\ is the only medieval manuscript attesting \Baldrsdraumar, and its variants of the poems attested in \Regius\ are clearly not copied from it, but rather derive from a common ancestor. This fact makes it very valuable for textual criticism. For further literature see TODO.

    Several Eddic poems are quoted in \Gylfaginning, namely (TODO): \Voluspa, \Vafthrudnismal, \Grimnismal. The text also quotes a few fragmentary verses of Eddic character (possibly from lost Eddic poems), which have here been edited together with their surrounding prose passages. For \Gylfaginning\ I have relied on the following four main mss.:\begin{enumerate}
	   \item The Codex Regius of the Prose Edda \RegiusProse\ (GKS 2367 4to; 1300-1350)
     \item The Codex Trajectinus \Trajectinus\ (Traj 1374; a c. 1595 paper copy of a ms. closely related to \RegiusProse.)
     \item The Codex Wormianus \Wormianus\ (AM 242 fol.; 1340–70)
     \item The Codex Upsaliensis \Upsaliensis\ (DG 11; 1300–25)\end{enumerate}

    For discussion on their internal stemmatics and origins I refer to \textcite{Haukur2017}. When all employed witness mss. of \Gylfaginning agree on a reading the siglum \GylfMS\ is used in the critical apparatus, which is thus equivalent to \RegiusProse\Trajectinus\Wormianus\Upsaliensis.

    A few other Eddic poems have also been edited. One of them, \Rigsthula, only survives in \Wormianus, though it is sadly incomplete (see its Introduction). Other Eddic poems survive only in younger paper mss., namely: TODO. While I have not consulted these paper mss. for poems attested in medieval mss., I have had to rely on them for these poems. Their exclusive survival there does not necessarily prove them to be late antiquarian works, as is clearly shown by \Baldrsdraumar, which among medieval mss. is only attested in the fragmentary \AM. It thus cannot be excluded that some of these poems would have existed in other lost medieval mss., perhaps even in the lost pages of \Regius\ or \AM.

    \subsubsection{West Germanic poetry}

    As none of the West Germanic poems edited here (TODO: Will we be editing other poems than Hildebrandslied?) survive in more than one copy, the specific details of their transmission is discussed in their individual Introductions.
