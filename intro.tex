\section{Germanic alliterative poetry}

  \subsection{Meter(s)}
    All of the oldest Germanic poetry has as its primary structural elements \emph{stress} and \emph{alliteration}.  The count of syllables is less important, and end-rhyme is only used as a sporadic flourish.  The following outline is not meant to be exhaustive.

    \subsubsection{Stress}
    When scanning alliterative meter each syllable is generally classed as having either primary stress (p), secondary stress (s), or no stress (x).  Primary stress is reserved for the root syllable in a word, which is not always the same as the first syllable.  Compare the English word \emph{beginning}, where the stress pattern is xPx; the primary stress falls on the syllable \emph{ginn-}.  Secondary stress falls on the second element in a compound word.

    Not all words have the same stress; the general rule is that nouns and adjectives have stronger stress than verbs, which in turn have stronger stress than prepositions and pronouns.  Where exceptions occur this coincides with semantic stress, e.g. in a statement like “It was \emph{you}!”

    \subsubsection{Alliteration}
    Alliteration is the resonance between two stressed syllables beginning with the same sound, e.g. \emph{\alst{s}and} with \emph{re\alst{c}eive}, or \emph{\alst{g}reat} with \emph{be\alst{g}in}.  The following additional rules apply for all Germanic alliterative poetry:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Any vowel or diphthong can alliterate with any other vowel or dipththong;
      \item \emph{s} and the clusters \emph{sk, sp} and \emph{st} are counted as four distinct sounds.
    \end{enumerate}

    Further, in West Germanic poetry,

    \begin{enumerate}[3]
      \item \emph{g} and \emph{j} are treated as the same sound
    \end{enumerate}

    In the present edition alliterating sounds are marked with red font.

    \subsubsection{Lines}
    Most alliterative poetry is written in the same common meter, which in Old Icelandic poetics gets the name \emph{fornyrðislag} ‘measure of ancient words’.  The smallest metrical division is the \emph{position}, a concept related but not identical to the syllable.  For instance, two short syllables (that is, one where a short vowel is followed by a single consonant) can \emph{resolve} into a single position.

    Four positions—two stressed, two unstressed—make up the normal \emph{half-line} or \emph{verse}.  Two half-lines separated by a short break or \emph{cæsura} (here represented by the interpunct “·”) form a couplet or \emph{long-line}.  The first half-line (or \emph{a-verse}) may have either one or two alliterations on the stressed positions, with preference for the first position over the second.  The second half-line (or \emph{b-verse}) must always have an alliteration on its first stressed position; never on its second.

    In the present edition each long-line is printed on a new line.  This is already standard for the publication of West Germanic poetry, whereas many editions of Scandinavian poetry print each half-line.

    \subsubsection{Fits and stanzas}
    Bigger structures are \emph{fits} and \emph{stanzas}.  The former are found in the Old Saxon and English traditions, the latter only in the Scandinavian.

    A \emph{fit} is a section or canto in a longer epic poem.  It does not have a fixed length, but is generally around 70-85 lines long.  Thus the 3182-line \Beowulf\ is divided into 44 fits (for an average of 72 lines per fit); the surviving 5983 lines of \Heliand\ are divided into 71 (for an average of 84 lines per fit).  It is probably not a coincidence that the length of the fit is similar to the length of shorter legendary poems like \GudrunOne\ or \Hildebrandslied.  In \Heliand\ a new fit can begin in the cæsura; this does not happen in \Beowulf.

    In Scandinavian poetry a \emph{stanza} is a group of long-lines, typically (but far from always) four.  The regularity of stanza-length varies from poem to poem.


  \subsection{The age of the Eddic poems}%TODO: move to specific introduction of Eddic
    Linguistic criteria
    Archeological evidence
    Comparison with known Christian texts (Sólarljóð, Hugsvinnsmál)
    Snorri thought they were old
    Saxo had access to them
    Many of them clearly describe non-Icelandic surroundings
      Especially Hávamál is clearly Norwegian


\section{The present corpus}
  The scope of the present corpus is large; when complete it will contain most alliterative poetry extant in Old Germanic languages.  The poetry is grouped into the following categories:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Norse Mythic poetry}, i.e., that which directly treats the Germanic mythology.  This category is exclusively Norse for the simple reason that no West Germanic or Gothic mythic narrative poetry survive.
    \item \textbf{Heroic poetry of the Codex Regius}.  Since the heroic portion of the Codex Regius forms a coherent text, it is edited in full.
    \item \textbf{Other Norse Heroic poetry} from sources other than the Codex Regius.
    \item \textbf{West Germanic Heroic Poetry} in Old English and Old High German.
    \item \textbf{Galders}, i.e., alliterative spells and charms, both from runic inscriptions and latinate manuscripts.
    \item \textbf{Poetry on Christian subjects}.  This category includes explicitly Christian poems where the new religion or its stories are at the core of the work (Christian heroic poems depicting native legends, like \Beowulf\ and \Hildebrandslied, are not included here).
    \item \textbf{Runic poetry}, apart from that already edited under Galders above.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Exclusions}
    The (non-mythological) Norse alliterative poetry found in the saws of Icelanders and of ancient ages (\emph{forn-aldar-sǫgur}) are excluded.  It has already been admirably rendered in the \Skp\ series.  It would also require a somewhat different structure in terms of how it is rendered; the underlying poetry is often impossible to take out of its prose context, and in some cases it is questionable whether it ever existed on its own, or whether it was simply composed on by the prose author.  I think it would be more conscientious to simply edit the whole saws as \emph{prosimetra}, but this falls outside of the scope of the present edition, although I am not adverse to such an undertaking in the future.

  \subsection{Manuscripts}

    \subsubsection{Norse poetry}
    The so-called Eddic poetry is foremost found in two medieval Icelandic manuscripts.

    The first and most important is GKS 2365 4to, here \Regius. It dates to the 1270s and has 45 surviving leaves, containing TODO poems. Of these 10 are mythological; the rest heroic, dealing with legends mostly of the Migration Period. Notably, following fol. 32, there is a gap of missing pages in the heroic section, specifically cutting off \Sigrdrifumal. It is unclear how many leaves and poems are missing.
    \Regius\ is not just a compilation of poems, it shows editorial input as well. Several of the mythological poems are separated by short prose sections, which tie them together into a loose frame narrative, though it is clear from their style and composition that they are originally separate works. When it comes to the heroic poems long prose sections occur both within and between them, creating a \inx[C]{saw}-like prosimetrical form, where the prose in many cases holds up the poetry, rather than the reverse. The heroic half of \Regius\ clearly forms the basis for the later \VolsungaSaga. For further literature see TODO.

    The second ms. is AM 748 I a 4to, here \AM. It dates to the 1300s and is but a fragment, consisting of just 6 leaves. It contains only mythological poems, and in a different order from \Regius; unlike it there is no trace of a frame narrative. On the first two leaves are contained the final stanzas of \Harbardsljod\ (1r–v), the complete \Baldrsdraumar\ (1v–2r), and the first verses of \Skirnismal, after which a single leaf has been lost. The next four leaves follow eachother and contain the second half of \Vafthrudnismal, the complete \Grimnismal\ and \Hymiskvida, and the beginning of the prose introduction to \Volundarkvida. \AM\ is the only medieval manuscript attesting \Baldrsdraumar, and its variants of the poems attested in \Regius\ are clearly not copied from it, but rather derive from a common ancestor. This makes it very valuable for textual criticism. For further literature see TODO.

    Several Eddic poems are quoted in \Gylfaginning, namely (TODO): \Voluspa, \Vafthrudnismal, \Grimnismal.  The text also cites a few fragmentary Eddic stanzas, which are edited under “Eddic fragments from Snorre’s Edda”.  For \Gylfaginning\ I give variants from the following four main mss.:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The Codex Regius of the Prose Edda \RegiusProse\ (GKS 2367 4to; 1300-1350)
      \item The Codex Trajectinus \Trajectinus\ (Traj 1374; a c. 1595 paper copy of a ms. closely related to \RegiusProse.)
      \item The Codex Wormianus \Wormianus\ (AM 242 fol.; 1340–70)
      \item The Codex Upsaliensis \Upsaliensis\ (DG 11; 1300–25)
    \end{enumerate}

    For discussion on their internal stemmatics and origins I refer to \textcite{Haukur2017}.  When all employed witness mss. of \Gylfaginning\ agree on a reading, I use in the critical apparatus the siglum \GylfMS, which is thus equivalent to \RegiusProse\Trajectinus\Wormianus\Upsaliensis.

    A few other Eddic-style poems are also included.  One of them, \Rigsthula, partially survives in \Wormianus, though it is sadly incomplete (see its Introduction).  \Grottasongr\ is quoted in full in \Skaldskaparmal.  Other Eddic poems survive only in younger Icelandic paper mss., namely TODO.  While I have not consulted such paper mss. for poems attested in medieval mss., I have had to rely on them for these poems.  Of these poems it must be said, that their late attestation not necessarily proves them to be late \emph{compositions}.  This is most clearly shown by \Baldrsdraumar, which is first attested in the fragmentary \AM, and in longer form in later paper mss.  It thus cannot be excluded that some of these poems would have existed in other lost medieval mss., perhaps even on the now-lost pages of \Regius\ or \AM.

    \subsubsection{Old English poetry}

    The edited Old English poetry primarily derives from a few manuscripts.  Particularly important are the Exeter Book and \Lacnunga.


\section{The present edition}

  The present edition is divided into two equally large parts, presented side by side. Each stanza or group of verse lines is presented first in the original Old Germanic language, and then in English translation.

  \subsection{The Old Germanic text}

    In the present edition are found texts in four Old Germanic languages: Old Norse, Old English, Old Saxon, and Old High German.  All texts have been normalized according to my own standardised orthography for the respective languages. The orthographies are all designed to follow three core principles:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A faithfulness to the spoken language at the time when the texts were written, and the distinctions demonstrably found therein.
      \item A respect for the etymological origin of words, and their distinctions.
      \item A striving for a uniform orthography across the various languages, so that the same etymological sound should be written with the same character.
    \end{enumerate}

    These choices often stand in conflict with the orthography of the original manuscripts and with most earlier philological tradition, whence there is some reason to justify them.  My goal is to render the texts themselves in a manner that gives as much philological information to the reader as possible—not to present a facsimile edition for students of paleography.  This follows the philological methods used for printing e.g. the \Rigveda, which is generally printed in an entirely scholarly latinized orthography, not the original \emph{devanagari}.  Regardless, such important traits of the original manuscript tradition as the long \emph{ſ}, arbitrary punctuation, arbitrary spelling, and lack of line breaks, are seldom reproduced in modern editions of Old Germanic poetry.

    \subsubsection{General orthographic conventions}

    The following orthographic conventions are followed for all Old Germanic languages:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The voiceless dental fricative is always written with the letter \emph{þ}, never \emph{th}.
    \item Long vowels are marked with the acute accent, never the macron or circumflex, excepting
    \item those which have their origin in earlier dipththongs, which are written with the circumflex.
    \item In compounds where the first element has primary stress the elements are separated with a dash,
    \item but where the first element is a preposition they are separated with an interpunct.
    \end{enumerate}

    Below follow specifications for each specific language.

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old Norse}

    My Old Norse orthography is inspired by \textcite{FinnurEdda} in that it strives for a more archaic form than that of the surviving mss.; a form that instead represents the poetry as it may (in many cases, must) originally have looked. For this reason, it often has more in common with the proposed orthography of the First Grammatical Treatise than with the standard Old Icelandic orthography seen in most editions. The following list describes the differences from the standard Old Icelandic orthography:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item I distinguish short \emph{e} (from etymological short \emph{e}) and short \emph{ę} (from etymological short \emph{a} + \emph{i}-umlaut).
    \item I distinguish long \emph{á} and \emph{ǫ́}, as done by the First Grammatical Treatise.
    \item I use \emph{ǿ} and \emph{ę́} rather than the traditional \emph{œ} and \emph{æ}, to represent the vowels descended from Proto-Norse \emph{ō} and \emph{ā} after \emph{i}-umlaut (cf. the short \emph{ø, ę} < \emph{o, a} + \emph{i}-umlaut).
    \item I distinguish long nasal vowels \emph{ȧ, ė, ï, ȯ, u̇} from long oral \emph{á, é, í, ó, ú}, as done in the First Grammatical Treatise.
    \item I restore the old \emph{s}—which in modern Scandinavian and even in most Old Norse manuscripts has become \emph{r}, but which is found consistently in old manuscripts such as AM 237 a fol (c. 1150), and fossilized in forms like \emph{þaz} (i.e. \emph{þat’s}) in \Regius—in the words \emph{es} ‘which, that, where, when’, and in inflections of \emph{vesa} (later \emph{vera}) such as \emph{es} ‘is’ (3rd sg. pres. ind.) and \emph{vas} (3rd sg. pret. ind.). The following forms retain the \emph{r}, as it is there the result of Verner’s law, and not of this (much younger) sound change: the pl. pres. ind. (\emph{erum} etc.), the pl. pret. ind. (\emph{vǫ́rum} etc.), and the pl. pret. subj. (\emph{vę́rim} etc.)
    \item When metrically benefactory, I contract \emph{ek} ‘I’, \emph{eru} ‘are’, and \emph{es} ‘which; is’ to \emph{’k}, \emph{’ru} and \emph{’s}, respectively.
    \item I use \textcite{FinnurEdda}’s way of distinguishing between the relative particle \emph{es} and the verb \emph{es}: the first is appended to the previous word with only an apostrophe (e.g. \emph{hann’s} ‘he who’), while the second is separated by a space (e.g. \emph{hann ’s} ‘he is’).
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old Swedish and Danish}
    I employ the same conventions as those described for Old Norse above, including the marking of \emph{u}-mutated \emph{a} > \emph{ǫ} (that this was indeed found in the Eastern Nordic dialects is most clearly seen by the third-person personal pronoun, which shows \emph{u}-mutation in such forms as Swedish \emph{honom} ‘him’ < \emph{hǫ́num}, \emph{hon} ‘she’ < \emph{hǫ́n}).

    According to rule 3 in the general orthographic conventions above, I distinguish between \emph{ǿ} (< \emph{ǿ}) and \emph{ø̂} (< \emph{au, ęy}); \emph{é} (< \emph{é}) and \emph{ê} (< \emph{ęi}).

    Where unstressed vowels have been reduced into an schwa-like sound spelled \emph{e}, this is written with \emph{ę}.

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old English}
    I spell fronted or brightened etymological \emph{a} and \emph{á} with \emph{æ} and \emph{ǽ}, for instance in \emph{dæg} ‘day’ (< \emph{*dagaʀ}) and \emph{rǽd} ‘advice, counsel’ (< \emph{rádaʀ}).  These are contrasted with \emph{ę} and \emph{ę́}, which represent \emph{i}-mutated \emph{a} and \emph{á}, for intance in \emph{ęllen} ‘zeal, courage’ (< \emph{*aljaną}).

    An assimilated \emph{n} is marked with an overpoint, like in rule 3 of Old Norse above.

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old Saxon}

    \subsubsection{Normalization of Old High German}

  \subsection{The English translation}

    There is now a very large number of translations of the most popular alliterative poetic texts, namely \Beowulf\ and the \emph{Poetic Edda}.  These generally fall into two camps:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \emph{poetic} translations, which distort the precise meaning of the text for the sake of meter, often quite radically; and
      \item \emph{prose} translations, which nowise preserve the style or feeling of the original.
    \end{enumerate}

    Almost all translations, of both types, also tend toward the following inadequacies: obscuring or glossing over difficult technical and cultural terminology; rendering identically repeated phrases and words (formulae) differently at various places; and simplifying or rewriting kennings and other poetic expressions.  Even worse this is often done with little in the way of notes or commentary, to a point where the reader is sometimes left entirely oblivious to the sense of the original text.

    What sets my translation apart from previous English translations is that it aims to follow the style and register of the original text, without sacrificing the literal sense of the words.  This unfortunately means that literality and consistency at times must sometimes come at the cost of fluid idiomatic English, but it has the advantage of giving the reader an image of not just \emph{what} the original text actually says, but \emph{how} it says it.  The reader should keep in mind that he is in a very foreign land, that he is reading words ancient and long forgotten—not the \emph{New York Times}.

    Maybe this is a pointless effort? One could argue that a translation always is a betrayal, and that those truly interested in the exact meaning of every word in the original text should study just the original (in the original language).  While I do agree that the sufficiently interested reader should study the original texts in the languages in which they were written (something made much easier by the present edition with its notes and parallel edition), it is still a “hard ask” for those readers who are not philologically inclined, but instead students and scholars of history, comparative mythology and religion, anthropology, or literature; those who, for whatever reason, are interested in exploring the oldest poetic heritage of the Germanic peoples of northern Europe.

    \subsection{Anglish proper nouns}
      Perhaps the single most idiosyncratic part of the present translation will be its handling of proper nouns. I have opted to render all cultural and religious terms, names of places, heroes, gods, and other entities by their English cognates (thus \emph{Thunder} for Old Norse \emph{Þórr}) and where such do not exist, their philologically expected English (\emph{Anglish}) forms (e.g. \emph{wallow} for Old Norse \emph{vǫlva}).

      There are two reasons for this.  The first is ideological.  I believe that the Old Germanic myths and poems, their gods and heroes, are a shared heritage of Northern Europe.  When you translate texts from across Germany, England and Scandinavia you quickly come to notice how similar the diction is, how many names reappear. The Scandinavian \emph{Vǫlundr} is the same character as the English \emph{Wélund}; likewise Norse \emph{Óðinn} is the same as English \emph{Wóden}.  These are ultimately mere distinctions in pronunciation.

      The second is aesthetic.  Commonly accepted forms like \emph{Odin} and \emph{Thor} are debased.  They do not even represent the Old Norse pronunciation as accurately as possible within the constraints of English ortography (for instance, \emph{Odin} would be better anglicized as \emph{Othin}).  Many are also difficult for English speakers to pronounce, or lead to absurd confusions.  I shudder at hearing the word \emph{ę́sir} pronounced /aɪˈsɪ:ɹ/; even worse is when \emph{Ǫ́s-garðr} becomes “ass-guard”.
