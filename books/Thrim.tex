\bvb Wroth was then Wing-Thunder when he woke, and of his hammer was bereaved. His beard he took to shake, his locks he took to pull; resolved the son of Earth to look about.\evb

\bvb And he that word first of all did say: “Hear thou now, Lock, what I now speak, which nowhere is known, not on earth nor Up-heaven:\footnoteB{Formulaic, see Encyclopedia: \inx[F]{Earth and Up-heaven}.} the \inx[G]{Ease}[os] \ken*{= Thunder = I} has been robbed of his hammer!”\evb

Gotish \emph{saljan} \textcite[116]{Streitberg}: ‘\emph{opfern}; \textgreek{θύειν}’.} it to thee, as it were silvern.”\footnoteB{Regaining the hammer is of such importance to the gods (cf. v. 17; without it the Ease stand powerless against the \inx[G]{Ettins}), that Frow would lend the feather-hame to the greedy and untrusty Lock, even if it were made out of gold or silver.}\evb

\bvb Thrim sat on the mound,\footnoteB{Apparently a typical seating position for ettins. See \Voluspa\ 42 for other attestations.} the lord of \inx[G]{Thurses}: on his greyhounds the golden leashes he twirled, and on his mares the manes he cut even.\footnoteB{The image suggested here reminds one of the ancient “master of animals” motif, especially as attested on panel A of the Gundestrup cauldron.}\evb

\bvb Flew then Lock—the feather-hame rustled—until outside he came of the homes of the Ettins, and inside he came of the yards of the Ease. He met Thunder in the middle of the yards, and he \ken*{= Thunder} that word first of all did say:\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva „Hęfir þú ørendi \hld\ sem ęrfiði? &

\bvb {[Thunder quoth:]} “Hast thou an errand, as hardship?\footnoteB{Thunder asks Lock if he has bad news. The collocation \emph{ørendi} ‘errand’ \dots\ \emph{ęrfiði} ‘hardship’ is formulaic and occurs in X (TODO!!) places, including in st. 5 of \HelgakvidaHjorvardssonar.} Say thou aloft, the long tidings! Often sitting, tales fail each other, and lying down, lies are dealt.”\footnoteB{Proverbial. If one sits down and thinks too much over bad news, details will be left out, excuses thought up. Thus it is best that Lock immediately tell Thunder what he has learned.}\evb

\bvb Go they the fair Frow to find, and he\footnoteB{Unclear. Possibly Lock, since he was the speaker of the last verse.} that word first of all did say: “Bind thee, Frow, with a bride’s linen\footnoteB{A linen band tied around the bride’s head. TODO: Reference this note.}! We two shall drive into the Ettin-homes.”\evb

\bvb Wroth became then Frow, and snorted—the whole hall of the Ease trembled below—threw she off the great necklace of the Brisings: “Thou knowest that I will become the most man-eager,\footnoteB{Either Frow is speaking out of self-awareness of her own lustful inclinations, or the sense is that she will be accused of being lustful by the other gods, but there is no verb here corresponding to ‘accuse’.

\bvb Soon were the \inx[G]{Ease} all at the \inx[C]{Thing}, and the \inx[C]{Ossens} all at speech, and of this counseled the mighty \inx[G]{Tews}:\footnoteB{Identical to \Baldrsdraumar\ 1.} how they the hammer of Loride would seek out.\evb

\bvb Then quoth that \inx[P]{Homedall}, the whitest of the Ease; he knew well forth,\footnoteB{\emph{vita framm} ‘to know forth’, i.e. to know the future. Compare \emph{framvíss} ’forth-wise; prescient.’} like the other \inx[G]{Wanes}: “Let us bind Thunder with the bride’s linen; may he have the great \inx[P]{necklace of the Brisings}.\evb

\bvb Let us place by his side keys to jingle, and women’s garments to fall down about his knees, and on the breast broad stones, and skillfully let us tip his head!\footnoteB{This verse contains an interesting description of Viking age bridal dress: As the everyday manager of the household, keys were the mark of a respectable married woman. The “broad stones” on the breast are probably tortoise brooches, while the tipping of the head refers to some sort of bridal hat (TODO: Literature). Breast-brooches are also mentioned in \Volundarkvida\ 25, 36.}”\evb

„Mik munu ę́sir \hld\ argan kalla &

\bvb Then quoth that Thunder, the mighty os: “Me would the Ease call \inx[C]{degenerate}, if I let myself be bound with bride’s linen!”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þá kvað þat Loki \hld\ Laufęyjar sonr: &
„Þęgi þú, Þórr, \hld\ þęira orða! &
Þegar munu jǫtnar \hld\ Ásgarð búa &

\bvb Then quoth that Lock, the son of Leafie: “Shut thou, Thunder, those words up! Shortly the Ettins will settle Osyard, unless thou thy hammer for thyself dost fetch!”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Bundu þęir Þór þá \hld\ brúðar líni &

\bvb Bound they Thunder then, with bride’s linen, and with the great necklace of the Brisings. They placed by his side keys to jingle, and women’s garments to fall down about his knees, and on the breast broad stones, and skillfully they tipped his head.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þá kvað þat Loki \hld\ Laufęyjar sonr: &
„Mun ek ok með þér \hld\ ambǫ́tt vesa, &

\bvb Then quoth that Lock, the son of Leafie: “I will also with thee be a handmaid; we two\footnoteB{The form used, \emph{tvau}, is the neuter plural, i.e. one of the pair is female and the other male. This is either an error due to mindless copying of v. 11, or a backhanded insult against Thunder.} shall drive into the Ettin-homes.”\evb
\evg


\bvg

\bvb Soon \inx[C]{he-goats}\footnoteB{Thunder’s cart was driven by he-goats, and he is likewise called “the lord of he-goats” in \Hymiskvida\ 20, 31. See Encyclopedia.} were driven home, hasted onto the cart-poles; they were to run well. Crags burst, the earth burned with flame; the son of Weden \ken*{= Thunder} drove into the Ettin-homes.\footnoteB{A very similar but more detailed description of Thunder driving is found in Thedwolf’s \Haustlong\ 14–16. In both poems his wagon is drawn by he-goats, causing great cosmic disturbance: crags (\emph{bjǫrg} in both) are rent asunder and fires rage before him. See also \Baldrsdraumar\ 3 for a related description of Weden riding.}\evb

\bvb Then quoth that Thrim, the lord of Thurses: “Stand ye up, ettins, and strew the benches! Now bring me Frow as wife; the daughter of \inx[P]{Nearth} of the \inx[L]{Nowetowns}.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ganga hér at garði \hld\ gullhyrnðar kýr, &
\edtrans{øxn alsvartir}{all-black oxen}{\Bfootnote{Formulaic, also occurring in \Hymiskvida\ 18. That all-black (that is, spotlessly black) oxen were most valued is seen by the pairing with “golden-horned”. One may also compare Saxo (I.8.12), where the hero Hadding has to atone for his slaying of a heavenly being by the bloot of dark-coloured victims (\emph{furvae hostiae}): \emph{Siquidem propiciandorum numinum gratia Frø deo rem diuinam furuis hostiis fecit. Quem litationis morem annuo feriarum circuitu repetitum posteris imitandum reliquit. Frøblod Sueones uocant.} ‘In order to mollify the divinities he [= Hadding] did indeed make a holy sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to the god Frø. He repeated this mode of propitiation at an annual festival and left it to be imitated by his descendants. The Swedes call it Frøblot.’ This ancient ritual taboo is further paralleled e.g. by the Tanakh, where animals dedicated to Yhwh were to be without blemish (\textgreek{תָּמִ֖ים}, Leviticus 1:3)}}, \hld\ jǫtni at gamni, & %TODO: Hebrew.

\bvb There was the evening come quickly, and before the ettins ale brought forth. Ate he \ken*{= Thunder} one ox, eight salmons, and all the dainties which were meant for the women; drank the husband of Sib \ken*{= Thunder} three sieves of mead.\footnoteB{Cf. \Hymiskvida\ 15. It is rather interesting that the same kenning is used in both verses when both concern Thunder’s great eating; possibly one poet was playing on the other’s expression, or they were both referencing some now-lost work.}\evb
