If one sits or lies (\emph{liggjandi} means to ‘lie down’; it is rather unfoprtunate that the two sound the same in English) down and thinks too much over bad news, details will be left out, excuses thought up.

\bvb Then quoth this Lock, Leafie’s son: \\
“I will also with thee be a handmaid; \\
we two\footnoteB{The form used, \emph{tvau}, is the neuter plural, i.e. one of the pair is female and the other male. This is either an error due to mindless copying of v. 11, or a backhanded insult against Thunder.} shall drive into the Ettin-homes.”\evb\evg

hastened onto the cart-poles; they were to run well. \\
Crags burst, burned the earth with flame; \\
drove Weden’s son \ken*{= Thunder} into the Ettin-homes.\footnoteB{Thunder’s driving of his chariot is often connected with cosmic disturbance. So, his arrival in \Lokasenna\ (st. 55) is signalled by the mountains quaking. The most similar description to the present stanza is found in Thedwolf’s \Haustlong\ 14–16, where crags (there likewise \emph{bjǫrg}) burst asunder and fires rage before him. A possibly Indo-European parallel to this is the Vedic myth of Indra breaking the mountains and releasing the mountains (as described most famously in \Rigveda\ hymn 1.32). See also \Baldrsdraumar\ 3 for a related description of the god Weden’s riding.}\evb\evg

That all-black (i.e. spotlessly black) oxen were most valued is seen by the pairing with “golden-horned”.  One may also compare Saxo (I.8.12), where the hero Hadding has to atone for his slaying of a heavenly being by the blooting of dark-coloured victims (\emph{furvae hostiae}): \emph{Siquidem propiciandorum numinum gratia Frø deo rem diuinam furuis hostiis fecit. Quem litationis morem annuo feriarum circuitu repetitum posteris imitandum reliquit. Frøblod Sueones uocant.} ‘In order to mollify the divinities he [= Hadding] did indeed make a holy sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to the god Frø. He repeated this mode of propitiation at an annual festival and left it to be imitated by his descendants. The Swedes call it Frøblot.’ This ancient ritual taboo is further paralleled e.g. by the Tanakh, where animals dedicated to Yhwh were to be without blemish (\textgreek{תָּמִ֖ים}, Leviticus 1:3)}}, \hld\ \alst{jǫ}tni at gamni, & %TODO: Hebrew.

It is rather interesting that the same kenning is used in both stanzas when both concern the god’s great eating; perhaps one poet was playing on the other’s expression, or they were both referencing another, now-lost work.}\evb\evg

\edtrans{\alst{á}stir mínar, \hld\ \alst{a}lla hylli}{my love; all [my] holdness’}{\Bfootnote{Probably formulaic.  There are no preserved parallels in poetry, but there may be one in \Gylfaginning\ 49 (excerpt, following the death of Balder):
\emph{En er goðin vitkuðust, þá mę́lti Frigg ok spurði, hverr sá vę́ri með ásum, er \emph{eignast vildi „allar ástir mínar}} (so \Trajectinus\Wormianus; \emph{ástir hennar} ‘her loves’ \RegiusProse\Upsaliensis) \emph{\emph{ok hylli}, ok vili hann ríða á hel-veg ok freista, ef hann fái fundit Baldr, ok bjóða Helju út-lausn, ef hon vill láta fara Baldr heim í Ás-garð.“} ‘But when the gods came back to their wits, then Frie spoke and asked which one among the Eese \emph{would own “all my loves and holdness}, and will ride on the \inx[L]{Hellway} and see if he may find Balder and offer Hell a ransom if she will let Balder come home to Osyard.”’
We can tell from the citation of a \Ljodahattr\ stanza at the end of ch. 49 (see Eddic Fragments below) that Snorre knew one or more now-lost Eddic poems about Balder’s death, and it may be that one of these poems contained the same two long-lines as the present stanza.  For such a sharing of whole lines cf. e.g. st. 14/1–3 above, which are identical to \Baldrsdraumar\ 1/1–3.}}!“\eva

\bvb In came the wretched sister of the ettins, \\
she who for the bride-fee \ken*{= Millner} dared ask: \\
“Slide off from thy hands the red rings, \\
if thou wilt win my love, \\
my love; all [my] \inx[C]{holdness}.”\footnoteB{The sister, who was apparently the one who asked for the Hammer, now has the audacity to ask Thunder (disguised as Frow) to give her the very rings on his hands.}\evb\evg

\bvb Then quoth this Thrim, the lord of Thurses: \\
“Bear ye in the hammer, the bride to bless; \\
lay ye Millner in the maiden’s knee; \\
bless ye us two together by \inx[P]{Ware}’s hand!”\evb\evg

\bvb Laughed Loride’s \name{= Thunder’s} heart in the chest, \\
when, hard-hearted, he recognized the hammer. \\
Thrim he slew first, the lord of Thurses, \\
and all the ettin’s lineage he beat lame.\evb\evg

\bvb He slew the aged sister of the ettins, \\
she who for the bride-fee had asked; \\
a smiting she received for shillings, \\
and a strike of the hammer for a multitude of rings. \\
So got Weden’s son \ken*{= Thunder} back his hammer.\evb\evg
