This Old Norse galder is found in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript Cotton Caligula A XV.  It runs across the bottom margin of the two facing pages 123v and 124r and is written in very clear runes of Wiking Age long-stave type.  One rune, viz. \textbf{g} in \textbf{vigi} \emph{vegi} ‘smite’ is “stung”.  The text has no word separators.

The galder is very similar to those on the amulets from Sigtuna (U Fv1933;134, U NOR1998;25) below.  They all belong to a type of magical healing where an illness-causing devil is commanded to leave the suffering person.  The final line, \emph{viðr áðra-vari} ‘against pus of veins’ is probably a declaration of purpose.
