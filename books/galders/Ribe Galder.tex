A wooden stick from the Danish city of Ribe.  The galder is syncretic, and as such contains numerous pre-Christian elements, albeit in a Christian(ised) context.

The inscription may be conveniently divided into four parts.  Part one (ll. 1–4) contains an introductory prayer where the healer asks for the support of natural forces (Earth, Up-heaven and the Sun) and Christian divinitities (God and Saint Mary), that the healing may be successful.  Part two (ll. 5–8) ritually exorcises any sickness which may have entered any part of the body.  Part three (ll. 9–14) apparently warns the addressee that they will be haunted by “nine needs” (an old Heathen formula; see Note) until they pray.  Part four (ll. 15, which is probably prose) gives the personal name “Bonde”, perhaps the addressee, and concludes with an “Amen”.
