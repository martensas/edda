These two galders, preserved in a manuscript (TODO) are some of the only surviving examples of genuine Heathen galders from the continent.  Both share a common two-part structure, each beginning with an \emph{historiola} (a “historical” account describing the successful effects of the galder in the mythic past), followed by an \emph{imperative}, commanding that the willed magic effect take place in the present.

The first galder begins with the historiola describing a group of supernatural women in the midst of a battle, affecting its outcome by fastening or loosening fetters.  The imperative then commands that some fetters in the present be destroyed, so that captive(s) may escape.

The second galder begins with the historiola describing a group of Gods riding through the woods.  Among them is \inx[P]{Balder}, whose young horse sprains its foot.  Three Gods then sing (see Note to \emph{bi·guol} below) a healing-galder each over the horse; first the otherwise unknown goddess \inx[P]{Sithguth}, then the goddess \inx[P]{Sun}, and finally the god \inx[P]{Weden}.  The imperative (apparently the same one sung by Weden) then commands that a present sprain be healed.
