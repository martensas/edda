\bpb One shall take seven small small wafers, such as one offers [during the Mass], and write these names on each wafer: Maximianus, Malchus, Johannes, Martinianus, Dionysius, Constantinus, Seraphion.  After that shall one sing this galder which is henceforth said; first into the left ear, then into the right ear, then over the man’s head; and thereafter a maiden go forth, and hang it on his neck; and one do so for three days.  He will soon be well.\epb\epg

\bvb Here came walking in an inspiden wight, \\
had his harness in his hands; said that thou wert his horse, \\
laid his reins on thy neck; then they together began to ride from the land. \\
As soon as they came away from the land, then they together began to cool limbs. \\
Then came walking in the beast’s sister; \\
then she ended [it], and swore oaths, \\
that this never should harm the ailing man, \\
nor him who this galder might get, \\
nor whomever this galder could gale. \\
Amen, let it be.\evb\evg
