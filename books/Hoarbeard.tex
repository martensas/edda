\section{Introduction}

The poem can be seen as an allegory on class relations, namely between the self-owning yeomen farmers and the warlike earls, represented through their patron gods.

Of all Eddic poems \Harbardsljod\ is probably the strangest in terms of form. Verse length varies greatly, and many of the lines (see especially the final verse) are of an obscene length reminiscent of late continental Germanic poems like the Heliand; some simply have no metrical qualities at all. The young clitic definite is (uniquely) employed frequently throughout the poem. These criteria would seem to point towards a late origin for the poem (though not later than the late C13th, when \Regius\ was written).

Against this late origin speaks the presence of rare words (e.g. \emph{ǫgurr} v. 13) and a thorough understanding of the personalities of the two gods which would seem unlikely to stem from several centuries after the conversion of Iceland. The model devised by Sapp gives the poem a 57.8\% likelihood of being from the early C11th, and a 37.7\% likelihood of being from the late 11th. These scores are most similar to those obtained by \Gripisspa, a poem that on the surface seems much more archaic.

What could we then be dealing with? It may of course be that the poem is heavily corrupt, but there is no good evidence for this (apart from the above-mentioned irregularities). Most lines are readily understandable and fit well both within their respective context and the poem as a whole. I think a better solution to this problem is to assume that the poem has been acted out as a sort of carnivalesque theatre, with two masked actors, each playing one of the gods. This would explain the variations in meter and line length, and the prose; some lines were simply shouted out, and the lack of alliteration in them would then have a powerful, discordant effect.

This is shown also by uses of the word ‘here’ in sts. 9 and 14. TODO: mention concept of "double scene" by Lars Lönnroth?

Thunder also eats his goats in \Gylfaginning\ 44, where he butchers and cooks them in the evening and brings them back to life by blessing them with his hammer at dawn. \textcite{FinnurEdda} and \textcite{PettitEdda} prefer this reading; see also note to next stanza.—Many other scholars have here read an accusative plural of \emph{hafri} ‘oat’, i.e. ‘porridge, oatmeal’. Stiles (forthcoming TODO) connects this with Indrá’s (who is the Vedic equivalent of Thunder) “partner and yokemate” (\Rigveda\ 6.56.2) Pūṣán’s eating porridge (e.g. 6.56.1, 57.2). Another similarity Stiles notes between Thunder and Pūṣan is that both have chariots driven by goats (e.g. 6.57.3: “Goats are the draft-animals for the one”, 58.2: “Having goats as his horses”). Whether the Vedic tradition has split an original god into two or whether Thunder has absorbed elements of another god is hard to say.}}; \hld\ \alst{s}aðr em’k ęnn þęss.“\eva
