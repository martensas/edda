\bookStart{Introduction to Old Saxon Christian Poetry}

The forced conversion of the Saxons to Christianity was a notoriously violent process.

The two poems edited here form the totality of the Old Saxon poetic corpus. Both are Biblical, and although they are written in the language of traditional epic, apparently for a noble audience, they launch a pointed Christian attack on the Germanic warrior ethos and worldview.  Before the two poems I present the Old Saxon baptismal formula as an important piece of historical context.
