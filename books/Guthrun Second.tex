\section{The Slaying of the Nivlings (\emph{Dráp Niflunga})}

\bpg\bpa Gunnarr ok Hǫgni tóku þá gullit allt, Fáfnis arf. Ó-friðr var þá milli Gjúkunga ok Atla; kenndi hann Gjúkungum vǫld um and-lát Brynhildar. Þat var til sę́tta, at þeir skyldu gipta hánum Guðrúnu, ok gáfu henni ó·minnis-veig at drekka áðr hon játti at giptast Atla. Synir Atla vóru þeir Erpr ok Eitill, en Svanhildr var Sigurðar dóttir ok Guðrúnar. Atli konungr bauð heim Gunnari ok Hǫgna, ok sendi Vinga eða Knéfrøð. Guðrún vissi vélar ok sendi með rúnum orð at þeir skyldu eigi koma ok til jar-tegna sendi hon Hǫgna hringinn Andvaranaut ok knýtti í vargs-hár. Gunnarr hafði beðit Oddrúnar, systur Atla, ok gat eigi; þá fekk hann Glaumvarar, en Hǫgni átti Kostberu. Þeira synir vóru þeir Sólarr ok Snę́varr ok Gjúki. En er Gjúkungar kómu til Atla, þá bað Guðrún sonu sína at þeir bę́ði Gjúkungum lífs en þeir vildu eigi. Hjarta var skorit ór Hǫgna en Gunnarr settr í orm-garð. Hann sló hǫrpu ok svę́fði ormana, en naðra stakk hann til lifrar. Þjóðrekr konungr var með Atla ok hafði þar látit flesta alla menn sína. Þjóðrekr ok Guðrún kę́rðu harma sín á milli. Hon sagði hánum ok kvað:\epa

\bpb Guther and Hain then took all the gold, Fathomer’s inheritance.  Hatred was then between the Yivickings and Attle; he blamed the Yivickings for Byrnhild’s passing.  These were their terms, that they would marry off to him Guthrun; and they gave her a forgetfulness-draught to drink before she agreed to be married off to Attle. The sons of Attle were Earp and Oatle, and Swanhild was Siward’s daughter and Guthrun’s. Attle invited to his home Guther and Hain, and sent Winge or \inx[P]{Kneefrith}. Guthrun knew his wiles and sent a word with runes, that they should not come, and as a sign she sent Hain the ring Andwaresneat, and tied through it a wolf’s hair. Guther had asked for Ordrun’s hand, Attle’s sister, and did not get her; then he got Gleamware, and Hain had Costbeare. Their sons were Solwer and Snower and Yivick. And when the Yivickings came to Attle, then Guthrun asked her sons that they should ask for the life of the Yivickings, but they would not. The heart was cut out of Hain, and Guther set in the serpent-yard. He struck his harp and soothed the serpents, but an adder stung him unto the liver. King Thedric was with Attle, and had there lost almost all of his men. Thedric and Guthrun recounted their griefs to each other. She spoke to him and quoth:\epb\epg
