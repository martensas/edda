\section{Introduction}
While not an alliterative poem in the slightest, this short text is important for its mention of Saxon Heathen Gods, for which reason I have here set it before the Christian poetry, in order to give some relevant cultural context.

The format of the text is straight-forward and resembles the modern Catholic questions posed to participants during the Sacrament of Confirmation (TODO: reference).  The person to be baptised is to respond positively to three denying and three affirming questions; first to forsake the Devil, all “Devil-yields” (i.e. non-Christian rituals, see note to that word), and all the Devil’s works and words and followers, among which are listed the three Germanic-Saxon gods Thunder, Weden, and Saxneet; second to profess belief in each member of the Trinity: God the Almighty Father, Christ, son of God, and the Holy Ghost (P6).
