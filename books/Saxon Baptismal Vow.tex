While not an alliterative poem in the slightest, this short text is important for its mention of Saxon Heathen Gods, and as I have no section for Miscellanea, I have here set it first among the Christian poetry, in order to give relevant cultural context.  The format of the text is straight-forward and resembles the modern Catholic questions asked to participants during the Sacrament of Confirmation (TODO: reference).  The person to be baptised is to respond positively to three denying and three affirming questions; first to forsake the Devil (P1), all “Devil-yields” (i.e. non-Christian rituals, see note to that word) (P2), and all the Devil’s “works and words” and his followers, among which are listed the three Germanic-Saxon gods Thunder, Weden, and Saxneet (P3); and then to profess belief in each member of the Trinity: God the almighty father (P4), Christ God’s son (P5), and the Holy Ghost (P6).
