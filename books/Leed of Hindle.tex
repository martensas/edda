“Vaki mær męyja, \hld vaki mín vina,
Hyndla systir, \hld es í hęlli býr;
nú ’s røkr røkra, \hld ríða vit skulum

“Wake maiden of maidens, wake my friend, sister Hindle, who lives in the rock-face. Now is the twilight of twilights, we two shall ride to Walhall, and to the holy wigh†.

Biðjum Hęrjafǫðr \hld í hugum sitja,
hann gęldr ok gefr \hld gull verðungu,
gaf hann Hęrmóði \hld hjalm ok brynju,
ęn Sigmundi \hld sverð at þiggja.

Let us bid the father of hosts to be in his favour; he rewards and gives gold to the retinue. He gave Heremood helmet and byrnie, but Sighmund a sword to receive.

Gefr hann sigr sumum, \hld ęn sumum aura,
mælsku mǫrgum \hld ok manvit firum,
byri gefr brǫgnum, \hld ęn brag skǫldum,
gefr hann mannsęmi \hld mǫrgum rekki.

He gives victory to some, but to some gold, speech to many, and manwit to men; fair wind he gives to noble ones, and bray [POETRY] to scolds†; he gives valour to many a champion.

Þór munk blóta, \hld þess munk biðja,
at hann æ við þik \hld einart láti;

Hindle quoth:
“Thou art, Oughthere, born to Instone, but Instone was born to Elf the Old, Elf to Wolf, Wolf to Seafare, but Seafare to Swan the Red.

Thy father had thy mother through [his] generosity of neckrings, I think that she was called Leedise the giddy (*gyðja*, female priest). Frood was her father, but Friend her mother; all her family seemed to be overmen.

Ed was before [that] the most powerful of men, Halfdane earlier the highest of Shieldings. Renowned were the troop-battles which the famous ones performed; his [Halfdane's] works seemed to travel around the corners of heaven.

He [Halfdane] became the in-law of Iemund, the noblest of men, but he slew Sightrue with cool edges. He went on to own Almwae, the noblest of women; they begot and had eighteen sons.

Thereof are the Shieldings! Thereof are the Shelvings! Thereof are the Inglings! Thereof is born of hero! Thereof is born of chief, the mightiest choice of men in Midyard! That is all thy family, foolish Oughthere!”
