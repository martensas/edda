“Vaki mær męyja, \hld vaki mín vina,
Hyndla systir, \hld es í hęlli býr;
nú ’s røkr røkra, \hld ríða vit skulum
til Valhallar \hld ok til vés hęilags.

Frow quoth:
“Wake maiden of maidens, wake my friend, sister Hindle, who lives in the rock-face. Now is the twilight of twilights, we two shall ride to Walhall, and to the holy wigh†!

Biðjum Hęrjafǫðr \hld í hugum sitja,
hann gęldr ok gefr \hld gull verðugum\footnotemark[1],
gaf hann Hęrmóði \hld hjalm ok brynju,
ęn Sigmundi \hld sverð at þiggja.
\footnotetext[1] Emended by Finnur and Guðni to \emph{verðungu}, 'to the retinue'.

Let us bid the Father of Hosts <= Weden> to be in his favour; he rewards and gives gold to the worthy. He gave Heremood helmet and byrnie, but Sighmund a sword to receive.

Gefr hann sigr sumum\footnotetext[1], \hld ęn sumum\footnotetext[2] aura,
mælsku mǫrgum \hld ok manvit firum,
byri gefr brǫgnum, \hld ęn brag skǫldum,
gefr hann mannsęmi \hld mǫrgum rekki.
\footnotetext[1] ms. \emph{sonum}
\footnotetext[2] ms. \emph{suinnum}

He gives victory to some, but to some silver\footnotemark[1]; speech to many, and manwit to men. Fair wind he gives to noble ones, and bray [POETRY] to scolds†; he gives valour to many a champion.
\footnotemark[1] Lit. "ounces".

Þór munk blóta, \hld þess munk biðja,
at hann æ við þik \hld einart láti;
þó ’s hǫ́num ótítt \hld við jǫtuns brúðir.

To Thunder I will bloot†, and bid for this, that he always might show friendliness to thee, although he is prejudiced against the brides of the ettins\footnotemark[1].
\footnotetext[1] Lit. “though [it] is to him infrequent with ettin's brides”.

Nú taktu ulf þinn \hld ęinn af stalli,
lát hann rinna \hld með runa mínum.”
[Hyndla kvað:] Sęinn es gǫltr þinn \hld goðveg troða,
vilkat mar minn \hld mætan hlǿða.

Now take thy single wolf from the stable; let him run with my boar.” [Hindle quoth:] “Slow is thy boar, to tread the Godways; I wish not lade my dear steed.”

Flǫ́ est Fręyja, \hld es fręistar mín,
visar þú augum \hld á oss þannig,
es hafir ver þinn \hld í valsinni
Óttar unga \hld Innsteins bur.”

Thou art deicitful, Frow, as thou tempts me; thou shows thy eyes on us this way, since thou hast thy man on the Walways: the young Oughthere, Instone's offspring.”

[Fręyja kvað:]
“Dulið est Hyndla, \hld draums ætlak þér,
es kveðr ver minn \hld í valsinni.

Frow quoth:
Thou art foolish, Hindle, I think thee dreamy, saying my man [is] on the Walways.

Þar’s gǫltr glóar \hld Gullinbursti,
Hildisvíni, \hld es mér hagir gęrðu,
dvergar tvęir \hld Dáinn ok Nabbi.

There the boar glows, Goldenbristle, the hildswine\footnotemark[1], which the skillful for me made: the two dwarves Dowen and Nab.
\footnotemark[1] \emph{Hildisvíni} 'battle-swine', in this case probably an alternative name for Goldenbristle.

Sęnn í sǫðlum \hld sitja vit skulum
ok of jǫfra \hld ættir dǿma,
(gumna þęira, \hld es frá goðum kómu).

Soon in the saddles we two shall sit, and judge about the aughts† of princes, of those men who came from the gods.

Þęir hafa vęðjat \hld Vala malmi
Óttarr ungi \hld ok Angantýr;
skylt ’s at vęita, \hld svát skati hinn ungi
fǫðurlęifð hafi \hld ępt frændr sína.

They have wagered on the Welsh ore [GOLD], Oughthere and Ongenthew; it is required to grant, so that the young prince might have the fatherly inheritance left behind by his kinsmen.\footnotemark[1]
\footnotemark[1] Lit. 'the father-remains after his kinsmen'. — Happening seems to be that Oughthere and Ongenthew each lay claim the inheritance. In order to settle the matter (in Oughthere's favour) Hindle must (\emph{skylt es} “it is required, obligated”) divulge (\emph{vęita} ‘to grant, to give away’) what she knows about his lineage.

Hǫrg hann mér gęrði \hld hlaðinn stęinum;
nú ’s grjót þat \hld at glęri orðit;
rauð hann í nýju \hld nauta blóði;
æ trúði Óttarr \hld á ǫ́synjur.\footnotemark[1]
\footnotemark[1] Frow argues yet further in favour of Oughthere, bringing up his piety shown towards the godesses.

A harrow† he made for me, loaded with stones; now that stone-pile is become into glass. He reddened [it] in fresh blood of oxen; Oughthere ever trusted on the osennies†.

Nú lát-tu forna \hld niðja talða
ok uppbornar \hld ættir manna
hvat ’s Skjǫldunga, \hld hvat ’s Skilfinga,
hvat ’s Ǫðlinga \hld hvat ’s Ylfinga
hvat ’s hǫldborit, \hld hvat ’s hęrsborit
męst manna val \hld und Miðgarði?

Now let be recounted the ancient lines of kinsmen, and the upborn\footnote[1] aughts† of men: What is of the Shieldings? What is of the Shilvings? What is of the Athlings? What is of the Wolvings? What is born of hero? What is born of chief, the mightiest choice of men in Midyard?”
\footnote[1] Noble.

Þú est Óttarr \hld borinn Innstęini,
ęn Innstęinn vas \hld Alfi inum gamla,
Alfr vas Ulfi, \hld Ulfr Sæfara,
ęn Sæfari \hld Svan inum rauða.

Hindle quoth:
“Thou\footnote[1] art, Oughthere, born to Instone, but Instone was born to Elf the old, Elf to Wolf, Wolf to Seafare, but Seafare to Swan the red.
\footnote[1] Hindle, apparently in a trance-like state, speaks straight to Oughthere.

Móður átti faðir þinn \hld męnjum gǫfga,
hygg at héti \hld Hlédís gyðja,
Fróði vas faðir þęirar, \hld ęn Fríund\footnotemark[1] móðir;
ǫll þótti ætt sú \hld með yfirmǫnnum.
\footnotemark[1] Emended from the meaningless ms. reading \emph{friaut}.

Thy father had thy mother, beautiful with neck-rings, I think that she was called Leedise yidde†. Frood was her father, but Friend her mother; all her aught seemed to be among overmen.

Auði vas áðr \hld ǫflgastr manna,
Halfdanr fyrri \hld hæstr Skjǫldunga,
fræg vǫ́ru folkvíg, \hld þaus framir gęrðu,
hvarfla þóttu verk \hld með himins skautum.
    
Ed was before [that] the most powerful of men, Halfdane earlier the highest of Shieldings. Renowned were the troop-battles which the famous ones performed; his <= Halfdane's> works seemed to travel around the corners of heaven.

Ęflðisk við Ęymund \hld ǿztan manna
ęn vá Sigtrygg \hld með svǫlum ęggjum,
ęiga gekk Almvęig, \hld ǿzta kvinna,
ólu þau ok ǫ́ttu \hld átján sonu.
    
He <= Halfdane> became the in-law of Iemund\footnotemark[1], the noblest of men, but he slew Sightrue with cool edges. He went on to have Elmwey, the noblest of women; they begot and had eighteen sons.
\footnotemark[1] Lit. "[he] was strengthened by". Parallelism of "noblest of men/women" makes the meaning yet clearer. Elmwey was Iemund's daughter or sister.

Þaðan eru Skjǫldungar, \hld þaðan eru Skilfingar,
þaðan eru Ǫðlingar, \hld þaðan eru Ynglingar,
þaðan es hǫldborit, \hld þaðan es hęrsborit,
mest mannaval \hld und Miðgarði;
alt ’s þat ætt þín, \hld Óttarr heimski.

Thereof are the Shieldings! Thereof are the Shilvings! Thereof are the Inglings!\footnotemark[1] Thereof is born of hero! Thereof is born of chief, the mightiest choice of men in Midyard! That is all thy aught†, foolish Oughthere!”
\footnotemark[1] Note the contradiction with v. 12. Since the Inglings have already been mentioned (under the name Shilvings, of the difference between the two see the index), it seems likely that Wolvings is the original reading.

Vas Hildigunnr \hld hęnnar móðir,
Svǫ́fu barn \hld ok sækonungs;
alt ’s þat ætt þín, \hld Óttarr hęimski.
varðar\footnote[1] at viti svá, \hld viltu ęnn lęngra?
\footnote[1] Emended from ms. \emph{varði}.

Hildguth was her mother, the child of Swabe and Seaking; that is all thy aught†, foolish Oughthere!—It is meaningful that one might know thus; wilt thou [go] yet further?

Dagr átti Þóru \hld dręngjamóður,
ólusk í ætt þar \hld ǿztir kappar,
Fraðmarr ok Gyrðr \hld ok Frekar báðir,
Ámr ok Jǫsurmarr, \hld Alfr hinn gamli.
varðar at viti svá, \hld viltu ęnn lęngra?

Day had Thure, the mother of valiant men; in that aught were begotten the noblest champions: Fradmer and Yird, and both Frecks; Ame and Essirmer; Elf the old.—It is meaningful that one might know thus; wilt thou [go] yet further?

Kętill hét vinr þęira \hld Klypps arfþęgi,
vas hann móðurfaðir \hld móður þinnar;
þar vas Fróði \hld fyrr ęnn Kári,
ęn Hildi vas \hld Hóalfr of getinn.

Kettle, the inheritor of Clip, was their friend; he was the father of thy mother's mother. There was Frood, yet earlier Keer, but Highelf was by Hild begotten.
