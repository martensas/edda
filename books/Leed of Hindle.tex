“Vaki mær męyja, \hld vaki mín vina,
Hyndla systir, \hld es í hęlli býr;
nú ’s røkr røkra, \hld ríða vit skulum
til Valhallar \hld ok til vés hęilags.

Frow quoth:
“Wake maiden of maidens, wake my friend, sister Hindle, who lives in the rock-face. Now is the twilight of twilights, we two shall ride to Walhall, and to the holy wigh†.

Biðjum Hęrjafǫðr \hld í hugum sitja,
hann gęldr ok gefr \hld gull verðungu,
gaf hann Hęrmóði \hld hjalm ok brynju,
ęn Sigmundi \hld sverð at þiggja.

Let us bid the father of hosts to be in his favour; he rewards and gives gold to the retinue. He gave Heremood helmet and byrnie, but Sighmund a sword to receive.

Gefr hann sigr sumum, \hld ęn sumum aura,
mælsku mǫrgum \hld ok manvit firum,
byri gefr brǫgnum, \hld ęn brag skǫldum,
gefr hann mannsęmi \hld mǫrgum rekki.

He gives victory to some, but to some gold, speech to many, and manwit to men; fair wind he gives to noble ones, and bray [POETRY] to scolds†; he gives valour to many a champion.

Þór munk blóta, \hld þess munk biðja,
at hann æ við þik \hld einart láti;
þó ’s hǫ́num ótítt \hld við jǫtuns brúðir.

To Thunder I will bloot†, and bid for this, that he always might show friendliness to thee, although he is prejudiced against the brides of the ettins\footnotemark[1].
\footnotetext[1]{Lit. “though it is to him infrequent with ettin's brides”.}

Nú taktu ulf þinn \hld ęinn af stalli,
lát hann rinna \hld með runa mínum.”

Now take thy single wolf from the stable; let him run with my boar.”

Sęinn es gǫltr þinn \hld goðveg troða,
vilkat mar minn \hld mætan hlǿða.

Flǫ́ est Fręyja, \hld es fręistar mín,
visar þú augum \hld á oss þannig,
es hafir ver þinn \hld í valsinni
Óttar unga \hld Innsteins bur.

Dulið est Hyndla, \hld draums ætlak þér,
es kveðr ver minn \hld í valsinni.

Þars gǫltr glóar \hld Gollinbursti,
Hildisvíni, \hld es mér hagir gęrðu,
dvergar tvęir \hld Dáinn ok Nabbi.

Sęnn í sǫðlum \hld sitja vit skulum
ok of jǫfra \hld ættir dœma,
(gumna þęira, \hld es frá goðum kómu).

Þęir hafa vęðjat \hld Vala malmi
Óttarr ungi \hld ok Angantýr;
skylt ’s at vęita, \hld svát skati hinn ungi
fǫðurlęifð hafi \hld ępt frændr sína.

Hǫrg hann mér gęrði \hld hlaðinn stęinum;
nú ’s grjót þat \hld at glęri orðit;
rauð hann í nýju \hld nauta blóði;
æ trúði Óttarr \hld á ǫ́synjur.

Frow quoth:
“A harrow he made for me, loaded with stones; now that stone-pile is become into glass. He reddened [it] in fresh blood of oxen; Oughthere ever trusted on the osennies.

Now recite the ancient lines of kinsmen, and the upborn\footnote[1] aughts of men: What is of the Shieldings? What is of the Shilvings? What is of the Athlings? What is of the Wolvings? What is born of hero? What is born of chief, the mightiest choice of men in Midyard?”
\footnote[1]{Noble.}

Hindle quoth:
“Thou art, Oughthere, born to Instone, but Instone was born to Elf the Old, Elf to Wolf, Wolf to Seafare, but Seafare to Swan the Red.

Thy father had thy mother through [his] generosity of neckrings, I think that she was called Leedise the giddy (*gyðja*, female priest). Frood was her father, but Friend her mother; all her family seemed to be overmen.

Ed was before [that] the most powerful of men, Halfdane earlier the highest of Shieldings. Renowned were the troop-battles which the famous ones performed; his [Halfdane's] works seemed to travel around the corners of heaven.

He [Halfdane] became the in-law of Iemund, the noblest of men, but he slew Sightrue with cool edges. He went on to have Elmwey, the noblest of women; they begot and had eighteen sons.

Thereof are the Shieldings! Thereof are the Shilvings! Thereof are the Inglings! Thereof is born of hero! Thereof is born of chief, the mightiest choice of men in Midyard! That is all thy family, foolish Oughthere!”
