\bva „Vaki mę́r męyja, \hld\ vaki mín vina, &
Hyndla systir, \hld\ es í hęlli býr; &
nú ’s røkr røkra, \hld\ ríða vit skulum &
til Valhallar \hld\ ok til vés hęilags.\eva

\bvb Frow quoth:
“Wake, maiden of maidens; wake my friend, sister Hindle, who lives in the rock-face! Now is the twilight of twilights; we two shall ride to Walhall, and to the holy \inx[C]{wigh}!\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Biðjum Hęrjafǫðr \hld\ í hugum sitja, &
hann geldr ok gefr \hld\ gull \edtext{verðugum}{\Afootnote{emended to \emph{verðungu} ‘to the retinue’ by \textcite{FinnurEdda}, \textcite{GudniEdda}}}, &
gaf hann Hęrmóði \hld\ hjalm ok brynju, &
ęn Sigmundi \hld\ sverð at þiggja.\eva

\bvb Let us bid Harryfather \name{= Weden} in good spirits to remain; he rewards and gives gold to the worthy: He gave \inx[P]{Heremod} helmet and byrnie, but \inx[P]{Sighmund} a sword to receive.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Gefr hann sigr sonum, \hld\ ęn svinnum aura, &
mę́lsku mǫrgum \hld\ ok manvit firum, &
byri gefr brǫgnum, \hld\ ęn brag skǫldum, &
gefr hann mannsęmi \hld\ mǫrgum rekki.\eva

\bvb He gives victory to sons, but to the wise silver; speech to many, and \inx[C]{manwit} to men. Fair wind he gives to noble ones, and poetry to \inx[C]{scold}[scolds]; he gives valour to many a champion.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þór munk blóta, \hld\ þess munk biðja, &
at hann ę́ við þik \hld\ ęinart láti; &
þó ’s hǫ́num ótítt \hld\ við jǫtuns brúðir.\eva

\bvb To Thunder I will \inx[C]{bloot}, of this I will bid: that he always show friendliness to thee, although he dislikes the brides of the ettins.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Nú taktu ulf þinn \hld\ ęinn af stalli, &
lát hann rinna \hld\ með runa mínum.“ &
[Hyndla kvað:] „Sęinn es gǫltr þinn \hld\ goðveg troða, &
vil’k-at mar minn \hld\ mę́tan hlǿða.\eva

\bvb Now take thy single wolf from the stable; let him run with my boar.” [Hindle quoth:] “Slow is thy boar to tread the Godways; I wish not load my noble steed.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Flǫ́ ert Fręyja, \hld\ es fręistar mín, &
visar þú augum \hld\ á oss þannig, &
es hafir ver þinn \hld\ í valsinni &
Óttar unga \hld\ Innstęins bur.“\eva

\bvb Deicitful art thou, Frow, as thou temptest me; thou showest thy eyes on us this way as thou hast thy man on the Walways; the young Oughter, Instone's offspring.”\evb
\evg


\bvg {\small [Frow quoth:]}
\bva „Dulið ert Hyndla, \hld\ draums ę́tlak þér, &
es kveðr ver minn \hld\ í valsinni.\eva

\bvb Deluded art thou, Hindle; I think thee dreamy as thou sayest that my man is on the Walways.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þar’s gǫltr glóar \hld\ Gullinbursti, &
\edtext{Hildisvíni}{\lemma{Hildisvíni ‘Hildswine’}\Bfootnote{Presumably an alternative name of Goldenbristle.}}, \hld\ es mér hagir gęrðu, &
dvergar tvęir \hld\ Dáinn ok Nabbi.\eva

\bvb There where the boar glows, Goldenbristle; the Hildswine, which for me the two skillful dwarfs Dowen and Nab made.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Sęnn í sǫðlum \hld\ sitja vit skulum &
ok of jǫfra \hld\ ę́ttir dǿma, &
gumna þęira, \hld\ es frá goðum kómu.\eva

\bvb Soon in the saddles we two shall sit, and converse about the lineages of princes; [the lineages] of those men who came from the gods.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þęir hafa vęðjat \hld\ vala malmi &
Óttarr ungi \hld\ ok Angantýr; &
skylt ’s at vęita, \hld\ svá’t skati hinn ungi & &
fǫðurlęifð hafi \hld\ ępt frę́ndr sína.\eva

\bvb They have wagered the Welsh ore \ken{gold}, young Oughter and Ongenthew; it must be divulged,\footnoteB{Hindle must reveal what she knows} so that the young prince may have the fatherly inheritance left behind by his kinsmen.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Hǫrg hann mér gęrði \hld\ hlaðinn stęinum; &
nú ’s grjót þat \hld\ at glęri orðit; &
rauð hann í nýju \hld\ nauta blóði; &
ę́ trúði Óttarr \hld\ á ǫ́synjur.\eva

\bvb A \inx[C]{harrow} he made for me, loaded with stones; now that stone-pile is become into glass. He reddened [it] in fresh blood of oxen; Oughter ever trusted on the \inx[G]{Ossens}.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Nú lát forna \hld\ niðja talða &
ok uppbornar \hld\ ę́ttir manna &
hvat ’s Skjǫldunga, \hld\ hvat ’s Skilfinga, &
hvat ’s Ǫðlinga \hld\ hvat ’s Ylfinga & &
hvat ’s hǫldborit, \hld\ hvat ’s hęrsborit &
męst manna val \hld\ und Miðgarði?“\eva

\bvb Now let ancient ancestors be counted, and the high-born lineages of men: What is of the Shieldings? What is of the Shilvings? What is of the Athlings? What is of the Wolvings? What is born of hero? What is born of chief, the mightiest choice of men in Middenyard?”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva „Þú ert Óttarr \hld\ borinn Innstęini, &
ęn Innstęinn vas \hld\ Alfi inum gamla, &
Alfr vas Ulfi, \hld\ Ulfr Sę́fara, &
ęn Sę́fari \hld\ Svan inum rauða.\eva

\bvb Hindle quoth:
“Thou\footnoteB{Hindle, maybe in a trance-like state, speaks straight to Oughter.} art, Oughter, born to Instone, but Instone was born to Elf the old, Elf to Wolf, Wolf to Seafare, but Seafare to Swan the red.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Móður átti faðir þinn \hld\ męnjum gǫfga, &
hygg at héti \hld\ Hlédís gyðja, &
Fróði vas faðir þęirar, \hld\ ęn \edtext{Fríund}{\Afootnote{emend. from meaningless \emph{†friaut†} \FlatMS}} móðir; &
ǫll þótti ę́tt sú \hld\ með yfirmǫnnum.\eva

\bvb Thy father had thy mother, beautiful with neck-rings, I think that she was called Leedise the \inx[C]{gidden}. Frood was her father, but Friend her mother; all her lineage seemed to be among \inx[C]{overmen}.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Auði vas áðr \hld\ ǫflgastr manna, &
Halfdanr fyrri \hld\ hę́str Skjǫldunga, &
frę́g vǫ́ru folkvíg, \hld\ þau’s framir gęrðu, &
hvarfla þóttu verk \hld\ með himins skautum.\eva

\bvb Ead was before [that] the mightiest of men, Halfdane earlier the highest of Shieldings. Renowned were the troop-conflicts \ken{wars} which the famous ones performed; his \name{= Halfdane’s} works seemed to travel around the corners of heaven.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ęflðisk við Ęymund \hld\ ǿztan manna &
ęn vá Sigtrygg \hld\ með svǫlum ęggjum, &
ęiga gekk Almvęig, \hld\ ǿzta kvinna, &
ólu þau ok ǫ́ttu \hld\ átján sonu.\eva

\bvb He \name{= Halfdane} became the in-law of Iemund\footnoteB{Lit. "[he] was strengthened by". Parallelism of "noblest of men/women" makes the meaning yet clearer. Elmwey was Iemund's daughter or sister.}, the noblest of men, but he slew Sightrue with cool edges. He went on to have Elmwey, the noblest of women; they begot and had eighteen sons.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þaðan eru Skjǫldungar, \hld\ þaðan eru Skilfingar, &
þaðan eru Ǫðlingar, \hld\ þaðan eru Ynglingar, &
þaðan es hǫldborit, \hld\ þaðan es hęrsborit, &
mest mannaval \hld\ und Miðgarði; &
alt ’s þat ę́tt þín, \hld\ Óttarr hęimski.\eva

\bvb Thereof are the Shieldings! Thereof are the Shilvings! Thereof are the Inglings!\footnote{Note the contradiction with v. 12. Since the Inglings have already been mentioned (under the name Shilvings, for the difference between the two see Encyclopedia), it seems likely that Wolvings is the original reading.} Thereof is born of hero! Thereof is born of chief, the mightiest choice of men in Middenyard! That is all thy lineage, foolish Oughter!”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Vas Hildigunnr \hld\ hęnnar móðir, &
Svǫ́fu barn \hld\ ok sę́konungs; &
alt ’s þat ę́tt þín, \hld\ Óttarr hęimski. &
varði at viti svá, \hld\ viltu ęnn lęngra?\eva

\bvb Hildguth was her mother, the child of Swabe and Seaking; that is all thy lineage, foolish Oughter!—It is meaningful that one might know thus; wilt thou [go] yet further?\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Dagr átti Þóru \hld\ dręngjamóður, &
ólusk í ę́tt þar \hld\ ǿztir kappar, &
Fraðmarr ok Gyrðr \hld\ ok Frekar báðir, &
Ámr ok Jǫsurmarr, \hld\ Alfr hinn gamli. &
varðar at viti svá, \hld\ viltu ęnn lęngra?\eva

\bvb Day had Thure, the mother of valiant men; in that lineage were begotten the noblest champions: Fradmer and Yird, and both Frecks; Ame and Essirmer; Elf the old.—It is meaningful that one might know thus; wilt thou [go] yet further?\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Kętill hét vinr þęira \hld\ Klypps arfþęgi, &
vas hann móðurfaðir \hld\ móður þinnar; &
þar vas Fróði \hld\ fyrr ęnn Kári, &
ęn Hildi vas \hld\ Hóalfr of getinn.\eva

\bvb Kettle, the inheritor of Clip, was their friend; he was the father of thy mother's mother. There was Frood, yet earlier Keer, but Highelf was by Hild begotten.\evb
