A manuscript charm, as its header suggests, aimed against worms.  The worms (possibly maggots in an infected wound) are to leave the body (from marrow, to bone, to flesh, to skin) and instead go into some arrows, possibly a ritual implement.

\bvb Go out, Nesse, with nine small Nesses! \\
Out from the marrow into the bone, from the bone into the flesh, \\
out from the flesh into the skin, out from the skin into these arrows. \\
Lord, may it be so.\evb
