\bpb Siward concealed his name, because it was their belief in ancient times that the word of a \inx[C]{fey} man could do much if he baled his enemy by his name. He \ken*{= Siward} quoth:\epb\epg

\bvb {[Siward quoth:]} \\
“My lineage I declare is unknown to thee, \\
and my self the same.\footnoteB{The meaning is that Fathomer would not recognize Siward’s lineage (i.e. his father) or name, since he is an orphan who up until this point has not won any glory. He is not saying that he is lineage is unknown even to himself, since \emph{sjalfan mik} ‘my self’ is accusative, not dative.} \\
Siward am I called—Syemund was called my father— \\

\bvb {[Fathomer quoth:]} \\
“Who goaded thee—why didst thou let thyself be goaded— \\
my life for to destroy? \\
O gleaming-eyed swain, thou haddest a sharp father; \\
inborn traits show quickly.\footnoteB{The original is unclear. \emph{á skęið} means roughly ‘rapidly, quickly’, whence the expression \emph{ríða á skęið} ‘\CV: to ride at full speed’, but the other words are uncertain. \textcite{LaFargeGlossary} read ‘your innate qualities show quickly’, suggesting two unattested words: an adjective \emph{*áborinn} ‘innate, inborn’ and a verb \emph{*skjóa} ‘to show’. Yet the lack of i-umlaut in the supposed 3rd sg. pres. ind. \emph{skjór} is difficult. We would expect \emph{**skýr}, as in \emph{skjóta} ‘to shoot,’ with 2nd/3rd sg. pres. ind \emph{skýtr}. A solution here would be reading a 2nd sg. pres. subj. \emph{skjóir}, with a vowel TODO}”\evb

“Rule [his] fee shall every man, \\
always, until the one day; \\

Fathomer continues speaking, but there is probably something missing here, since the transition is abrupt. Between its paraphrases of st. 15 and of st. 16, \VolsungaMS\ has \emph{Ok enn mę́lti Fáfnir: „Reginn bróðir minn veldr mínum dauða, ok þat hlę́gir mik, er hann veldr ok þínum dauða, ok ferr þá, sem hann vildi.“} ‘And further spoke Fathomer: “My brother Rein causes my death, and it gladdens me that he also causes thy death, and then it will go like he has willed.”’, which may either be a paraphrase of a lost st., or an addition by the redactor.
