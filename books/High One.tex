\bookStart{The Speeches of the High One}[Hávamǫ́l]

%Introduction.

The \textbf{Speeches of the High One} is the second poem of \Regius, which is also the only ancient manuscript in which it is attested. Several sts. are however cited or alluded to in other places, such as Eyv \emph{Hák} (TODO: formatting) 21 and \FostrbroedhraSaga\ TODO.

The poem as it currently comes down to us hardly seems like a single composition, but instead more like a “grab bag” of traditional poetry associated with the god Weden.  It contains at least two poems of practical live advice, two mythological narratives, scattered gnomic poetry about runes, and a list of galders.  Little unites these various strands other than their speaker.

Following previous authors, I identify several such strands, excepting various lone sts. that are probably later inserts.  In the present edition each of them is given a separate, short introduction:

\begin{longtabu} to \textwidth {|c c c c c c|}
	\hline
  1–79 & The Guest-strand; practical life advice, beginning with a guest arriving at a homestead. \\
  81–89 & Various scattered sts. of advice. \\
  90–101 & Weden’s failed seduction of Billing’s daughter. \\
  102–109 & Weden’s obtaining of the Mead of Poetry \\
  110–136 & The Speeches of Loddfathomer; Weden’s advice to Loddfathomer. \\
  137–145 & The Rune-tally; various sts. relating to runes and their magical use. \\
  146–164 & The Leed-tally; Weden’s listing of 18 galders. \\
  165 & Final st., composed by the redactor or collector of the above poetry. \\ [1ex]
  \hline
\end{longtabu}

TODO: Discuss the Heathen identity of the redactor and the purpose of such a redaction.

\section{The Guest-strand (sts. 1–79)}

The Guest-Strand (Old Norse: \emph{Gęstaþáttr}) is possibly the finest work in Norse poetry. Sadly, its structure has been obscured by various inserted and possibly displaced sts. My hope is to shed some light on the original vision behind the poem, while as usual not changing the order of sts. as they appear in the only surviving witness manuscript.

The poem moves through many elements of life, but in a poetically almost seamless way. To move from one topic to another, the poet often employs transitions where a st. recalls the structure of the previous one, but with a new subject. This is particularly evident in sts. 4–5 and 10–11.

The strand begins with a st. encouraging travellers to be wary of entering strange houses without first spying out who is inside (1), after which a voice inside of a farmstead (possibly Weden?) announces that a guest is waiting to be let in (2). The same speaker then lists several things which the newly arrived guest needs from the host, namely: fire, food and clothes (3), water, a towel, a great welcome, a good reception, an opportunity to speak and silence in return (4).

After this focus shifts to the conduct of the wanderer, with an introductory st. explaining that he needs wit (specifically \inx[C]{manwit} (\emph{manvit}); see Encyclopedia), lest he become a laughing-stock (5). He should be silent but attentive, and choose his words carefully (6–7). He should be confident in himself and his own decisions, and not rely too much on the opinions of others (8–9), since there is nothing better one may bring along on the journey than much manwit (10).

Here the advice moves to the subject alcohol. Where the best thing one may bring along on the journey is manwit, the worst is too much ale (11). It is not as good as men call it (12) since it “robs [them] of their senses”; it is even personified as a “heron of forgetfulness” (13). A drinking round is best when the participants do not drink too much, but rather regain their senses afterwards (14).

St. 15 contains some general advice; a royal child should be silent, thoughtful and bold in battle, and all men should stay happy, until they die.

At such celebrations “holding onto” the vessel and refusing to drink was very rude; as late as 1519 a man in Jämtland was killed in an argument resulting from his refusal to pass on to the bowl (see \textcite{Sjöberg1907}).} \\

As nobody can excel at everything, nobody is complete; every person is “half” (and it should be added that ON \emph{halfr} has a more general sense of incompleteness than its English cognate).

The ancestral Proto-Norse forms would be \emph{*sāliʀ} and \emph{*wajē-sāliʀ}.

It carries with it a certain sense of innateness, in a way that modern Westerners may find foreign. So a king whose reign is one of peace (\emph{friðr}) is said to be \emph{frið-sę́ll} ‘blessed with peace’, while one who reigns during good harvests (\emph{ár}) is said to be \emph{ár-sę́ll} ‘blessed with harvests’.

On the other hand st. 87, with its \Ljodahattr\ meter and self-enclosed form seems a separate composition, and was probably inserted after 86 due to its first line (\emph{akri ár-sǫ́num}), which is also in the dative.

\section{Weden’s failed seduction of Billing’s daughter.}

The following sts. are united by their meter, \Ljodahattr\ (unlike most of the preceding sts., see introduction to them above) and by their logical progression, beginning with general maxims about love and relations between the sexes, before moving into the narrative about Billing’s daughter. The narrator is securely identified as Weden in st. 97.

\section{Weden’s obtaining of the Mead of Poetry}

The intricate myth of how Weden came to own the Mead of Poetry is told more fully in \Skaldskaparmal\ 5–6. That narrative goes as follows, with minor details left out:
After the war between the Eese and Wanes, the two tribes of gods reconcile through spitting into a vat. Not wanting to discard this token of their truce, they instead create a man out of the spit, calling him \inx[P]{Quasher}; he is so wise that he can answer any question posed to him, and so travels around the world in order to share his wisdom with humans.
Quasher eventually comes to the dwelling of two dwarfs, Fealer and Galer. They kill him and drain his blood into three vessels: two vats named Soon and Bothem, and a kettle named \inx[P]{Woderearer}. Through mixing the blood with honey they make a mead, with the power to turn anyone who drinks from it “a scold or man of learning (\emph{skald eða frǿða-maðr})”. The dwarfs then lie to the Eese about the murder, telling them that Quasher drowned in his own wisdom.
Some time later, the dwarfs murder an ettin named \inx[P]{Gilling} and his wife. Gilling’s son, \inx[P]{Sutting}, learns of this and prepares to drown the dwarfs. In exchange for their lives and as recompense for his father’s slaying, the dwarfs offer Sutting the “dear mead” (\emph{mjǫðinn dýra}; cf. here sts. 104 and 138). Sutting accepts the ransom and takes the mead home with him. He makes his daughter \inx[P]{Guthlathe} guard it.
Some time later, Weden is out journeying, and finds nine thralls mowing hay. He sharpens their scythes with a special whetstone, and the mowing improves greatly. He then throws it in the air and the thralls shortly kill each other over it. By evening Weden comes to the owner of the thralls, Bigh, Sutting’s brother. Bigh laments the death of his workmen, and so Weden, who calls himself \inx[P]{Baleworker}, offers to do the work of the thralls over the summer, in exchange for one drink of Sutting’s mead. Bigh tells him that Sutting alone owns the mead, but that he will accompany Baleworker to Sutting to ask for the drink.
The two arrive at Sutting, who as expected refuses to give any part of the mead away. Baleworker then tells Bigh that he will get to it anyway; he takes out the drill \inx[P]{Rate}, and tells Bigh to drill through the mountain, into the room where the mead is stored. Bigh first attempts to trick him by only drilling halfway, but eventually creates a narrow passage. Baleworker turns himself into a snake and crawls through it; as he does, Bigh tries to strike him the drill, but misses.
After coming through, Baleworker sees Guthlathe watching over the mead. He goes on to sleep with her for three nights, after which she promises him three sips of the mead. With each sip he swallows the contents of one of the three vessels, so that all of the mead ends up in his belly.
Having taken the mead, he dons his eagle-hame and flies away from the mountain. Sutting sees him, takes his own eagle-hame, and gives chase. The Eese see Weden in flight, and set out several large vat on the ground, into which Weden, still flying, spits out the mead. At this point Sutting has almost caught up with him, and so Weden “sends back” (\emph{sęnda aptr}, usually interpreted being sent out from the anus) some of the mead, presumably into his face. This portion becomes the lot of foolish poets (\emph{skald-fífla hlutr}), while the rest of the mead is given to the Eese and to skilled poets (\emph{þęim mǫnnum, er yrkja kunnu} ‘those men who can compose [poetry]’).

The core of this many-twisted myth is old. A close parallel is found in \Rigveda\ hymns 4.26–27. In these two hymns the \emph{soma} plant (who in the Vedic mythology is not just the plant and its resulting drink, but also a god, perhaps somewhat like Quasher) is first held within “a hundred iron forts” (4.27.1c: \emph{śatám púraḥ ā́yasīḥ}) by the archer \emph{Kr̥şānu}, before being stolen by a sweeping falcon. The falcon brings \emph{Soma} to \emph{Manu}, the ancestor of the Aryans and first sacrificer.

The resemblance to the last part of the \Skaldskaparmal\ account should be obvious, but, notably, the detail of the falcon is not found in any of the sts. below. This shows that the narrative of \Skaldskaparmal\ cannot be exclusively based on the sts. here below, but instead also relies on other, now-lost sources. This is also supported by the present sts. leaving out the narratives about Quasher, the two dwarfs, and Baye, along with some subtler narrative differences.

The order of the present sts. follows that of \Regius, their main witness manuscript. The strand begins with some social advice (102), after which the narrative follows (103–109). It is narrated in the first person by Weden himself. The sts. do not tell the myth in chronological order and leave much up to the listener; they are surely composed for an audience that already knows the story. The following narrative details are given:

\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{103}
	\item Weden visits Sutting’s home, but does not receive a good reception.
	\item Guthlate falls in love with Weden, and gives him a drink of the Mead.
	\item Weden has to bore through the mountains with the drill Rate.
	\item Weden has “bought [the Mead] well”; possibly a euphemistic reference to sleeping with Guthlathe for it.
	\item Guthlathe indeed does sleep with Weden, though not expressely in exchange for the Mead.
	\item The following day (\emph{hins hindra dags}, see note to this word in the edited text below), a group of Rime-Thurses come to Weden’s hall, to ask him whether a Baleworker is among the Gods, or if he has been slain by Sutting.
	\item Switching to the third person (which may indicate that this is his answer to the Rime-Thurses), Weden says that he “thinks” that Weden has sworn an oath, but that his words cannot be trusted. After the “simble” (i.e. drinking feast, banquet; probably referring to the drink of the Mead), Weden betrayed Sutting and made Guthlathe weep.
\end{enumerate}

The underlying narrative seems to generally agree with that of \Skaldskaparmal, but unlike its more transactional affair, we here find a stronger emphasis on Weden’s cruel betrayal of Guthlathe. A notable detail not found in \Skaldskaparmal\ is Weden’s oath in st. 109. The content of the oath was most likely that Weden would marry Guthlathe, something supported by the language used (see note to st. 108: \emph{hins hindra dags}). The recipient of the oath, which Weden clearly broke, was either Sutting or Guthlathe. That Weden swore it to Sutting, and thus asked him for Guthlathe’s hand in marriage, may be suggested by the description of Sutting as \emph{svikvinn} ‘betrayed’ in st. 109. This view, however, has an internal narrative problem: in st. 103 Weden describes his interaction with Sutting as poor, and in st. 105 Weden is said to have had to bore through the mountains, but this may just have been to reach Sutting, rather than Guthlathe as in \Skaldskaparmal.
The recipient of the oath being Guthlathe would agree better with the \Skaldskaparmal\ narrative, and Sutting’s betrayer would instead be her.

If we, however, search in the broader Scandinavian sphere, we find in the Swedish provicial laws an exact equivalent of the present phrase, namely OSwe. \emph{hindra-dagher}, a law-word referring specifically to the ‘day after the wedding’, used both on its own and in the expression \emph{hindra-dags gięf} ‘morning gift’.  If this is indeed the sense in the present stanza, two interpretations are possible: it either (i) refers sarcastically to Weden’s sleeping with Guthlathe (as would be done on the wedding night), or (ii) means that Weden actually married, or promised to marry, Guthlathe.

Up shalt thou not look in battle \\

lest men bewitch thy [sense/life/face].\footnoteB{A very difficult st. \CV\ explains \emph{gjalti} as an old dative of \emph{gǫltr} ‘boar, hog’, and thus sees the closely related phrase \emph{verða at gjalti} as “‘to be turned into a hog’, i.e. ‘to turn mad with terror’, esp. in a fight”. The vowel breaking is however unexpected here, since \emph{gǫltr} (< Proto-Norse \emph{*galtuʀ}) is an u-stem, which makes the stem-vowel in the dat. sg. \emph{gęlti} (< \emph{*galtiu}, cf. \textbf{kunimudiu}, dat. sg. of \emph{*Kunimunduʀ}, on the Tjurkö 1 bracteate) the result of i-umlaut rather than an original short \emph{*e}.

\textcite{LaFargeGlossary} instead explain the word as a borrowing from Old Irish \emph{geilt} ‘insane, mad’. \textcite{PettitEdda} follows this, and argues that the whole theme of the st. probably be of Celtic origin, giving several examples from Celtic literature of warriors going mad upon looking up into the sky during battle. In this case the men (\emph{halir}, which word seems to have an association with warriors; cf. 36–37, 49) would be to quote Pettit some sort of “supernatural sky warriors”, in my opinion most likely the \inx[G]{Ownharriers}.}\evb

\section{The Rune-Tally}

These scattered sts. are introduced by a larger initial in \Regius, marking the beginning of a new section. They have the header \emph{Rúna-tals þáttr} ‘Strand of the Rune-Tally’ in younger paper mss. and generally give an archaic, mystic impression; it is as if they were drawn from the lips of an Odinic priest.

Apart from these stanzas, there are a few other instances of Runic magic. Closest at hand is st. 80 above, which would fit seamlessly into the present section. Outside of \Havamal\ there is \Sigrdrifumal\ 4–16, also preserved in \Regius.

It mentions \emph{ljóð} ‘leeds; (magical) songs, incantations’ rather than runes, and has nothing to do with Weden’s hanging on the tree. Bestle was Weden’s mother and Balethorn his maternal grandfather. The famous son of Balethorn would then be his maternal uncle. The custom of sending sons away to be fostered by their maternal uncles or grandfathers (which seems to be what is going on here) was quite common in Germanic society, cf. TODO.}\evb

\section{The Leed-Tally}

This section of \Havamal, the so-called the Leed-Tally (\emph{Ljóðatal}), is not separated from the preceding section (which is marked out with a large initial), but is usually taken as separate since it is a unified whole not much concerned with runes. The speaker (certainly Weden) recounts eighteen spells, aristocratic and Odinic in character; they deal with such things as healing (spell 2, 12), battle (3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13), countering sorcery (6, 10), stilling the elements (7, 9), and seduction (16, 17).

In particular the fourth spell bears a strong likeness to the first Merseburg charm.

Their original bodies would of course be lying in a comatose state, and with the bodies their original minds; their humanness. Weden was through his second sight able to see these riders, and could use his superior magical abilities in order to confuse them so that they were not able to return to their original hames or minds (but were instead forced to wander astray); a cruel fate. — Weden likewise brags about tricking riders in \Harbardsljod\ 20.}\evb
