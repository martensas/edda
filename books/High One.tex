%Introduction.

The \textbf{Speeches of the High One} is the second poem of \Regius, which is the only medieval witness manuscript.  Several sts. are however cited or alluded to in other places, such as Eyv \emph{Hák} (TODO: formatting) 21 and \FostrbroedhraSaga\ TODO.

The poem before us does not very much seem like a single composition by one poet, but instead much more like a collection of scattered traditional poetry associated with the god Weden.  It seems to contain at least two poems of practical life advice, two mythological narratives, scattered gnomic poetry about runes, and a list of galders.  These various strands are united by their presumed speaker, namely Weden in His function as God of Wisdom.

Following previous authors, I identify the following strands, excepting various lone sts. that are probably later inserts.  In the present edition each of the following is given a separate, short introduction:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1–79 The Guest-strand; practical life advice, beginning with a guest arriving at a homestead
  \item 81–90 Various scattered sts. of advice
  \item 91–102 Weden’s failed seduction of Billing’s daughter
  \item 103–110 Weden’s obtaining of the Mead of Poetry
  \item 111–137 The Speeches of Loddfathomer; Weden’s advice to Loddfathomer
  \item 138–146 The Rune-tally; various sts. relating to runes and their magical use
  \item 146–165 The Leed-tally; Weden’s listing of 18 galders
\end{enumerate}

Two questions shortly arise: who was the redactor (i.e., the person who set these strands together, and gave the new work the title \emph{Háva mǫ́l}), and what was his motive?  While a detailed and sufficient answer will probably never be found, a careful reading of the final stanza, 165, gives us some clues.  By its prayer-like blessing, which brings up the Heathen dichotomy between the Gods and Ettins (the friends and enemies of Mankind, respectively) and calls the contents of the poem (which include unambiguous Heathen ritual instructions) “very useful” (\emph{all-þǫrf}); and by its reference to the process of oral transmission, the whole poem in something resembling the current form must (it seems) have been put together no later than the early 11th century, in a pre-scribal, pre-monastic, Heathen context. (Iceland converted around year 1000, but people surely clung to the old traditions for some time longer.)

As seen by the emphasis on the usefulness of the poetry, the reason for this redaction was not strictly antiquarian, but foremost utilitarian; the redactor gathered an amount of traditional poetry he found useful (whether for its life-advice or mythology) into a single poem, which could then be learned by heart by anyone.  In this he certainly achieved his goal.  The \Havamal\ is by far the greatest surviving collection of pre-Christian Norse advice poetry, and has functioned like a Noah’s Ark—or Hoardmimer’s Wood—for that genre.  Thus, those scattered stanzas which were not included by the redactor—and many must have existed—are now forever lost.

\section{The Guest-strand (sts. 1–79)}

The Guest-Strand (Old Norse: \emph{Gęsta-þáttr}) is one of the most interesting surviving works of Norse poetry.  Sadly, its structure has been obscured by the insertion of unrelated sts. and by poor translations.  My hope is to shed some light on the original coherence of the strand, while respecting the text as it appears in the manuscript.  As I do not think it can do each stanza justice, and since there is not exactly a clear progression of themes, I will not here attempt a stanza-by-stanza summary of this strand. Rather, I will give some important observations and then let the reader read for himself.

The Strand is a piece of advice poetry, and takes its outset in a wanderer’s arriving as a guest at a Norse farmstead.  It first (roughly sts. 1–4) discusses the mutual responsibilites between guest and host, and then moves on to broader human interactions, with a particular focus on alcohol, war, friendship and human wisdom.  While there is some coherence and nice transitions are frequently employed in order to shift from one theme to another (e.g. between sts. 4 and 5, or 10 and 11), the poem is not clearly divided into sections, nor is there (after the very first stanzas) a linear progression from one theme to another.

At all turns the poem advices caution and shrewdness.  A man should always carry his “manwit” (ON \emph{man-vit}, a word somewhat analogous with the English “common sense”) with him; he should think before he speaks

The poem moves seamlessly between various parts of life.  To do so the poet often employs transitions where a st. repeats the structure of the previous one, but with a new subject.  This is particularly evident in sts. 4–5 and 10–11.

The word \emph{ęndr-þaga} ‘silence in return’ leads a nice transition to the rest of the Strand, where proper social conduct (encompassed by the first word of the next stanza below, “wit”) will be discussed more broadly.  One may note that the verb \emph{þęgja} ‘shut up, be silent’ (of which \emph{*þaga}, which only appears in the present compound, is a derivative, formed in the same way as \emph{saga} ‘saw, history, story’ to \emph{sęgja} ‘say, speak’) and its derivative \emph{þǫgn} ‘silence’ are frequently used by Scoldic poets to mark the very beginning of their works (e.g. Arn \emph{Magndr} 1\textsuperscript{II}: \emph{þegi sęim-brotar} ‘may gold-breakers \ken{generous men} be silent’, Egill \emph{Berdr} 1\textsuperscript{V}: \emph{hyggi \dots\ til þagnar þinn lýðr} ‘may thy retinue focus on silence’, Glúmr \emph{Gráf} 1\textsuperscript{I}: \emph{biðjum vér þagnar} ‘we ask for silence’).}}\eva

The tradition of ideographic runes standing for their names is ancient and goes back to the time before Latin writing, as proven by the inscriptions from Stentoften (DR 357) and Ingelstad (Ög 43), which use the runes ᛃ \textbf{j} for \emph{ár} ‘year, good harvest’ and ᛞ \textbf{d} for \emph{dagʀ} ‘day’, respectively.

It carries with it a certain sense of innateness that is very foreign to modern Western culture.

In \Regius\ the following two sts. come in the opposite order, but it seems probable from its \Malahattr\ meter and the dative case of the words that 89 should follow 87.  On the other hand st. 88, with its \Ljodahattr\ meter and self-enclosed form seems a separate composition, and was probably inserted after 87 due to its first line (\emph{akri ár-sǫ́num}), which is also in the dative.

\section{Weden’s failed seduction of Billing’s daughter}

The following sts. are united by their meter, \Ljodahattr\ (unlike most of the preceding sts., see introduction to them above), style and content.  The strand begins with general maxims about love and relations between the sexes, before moving on to the narrative about Billing’s daughter.

\section{Weden’s obtaining of the Mead of Poetry (104–110)}

The intricate myth of how Weden came to own the Mead of Poetry is told more fully in \Skaldskaparmal\ 5–6. That narrative goes as follows, with minor details left out:
After the war between the Eese and Wanes, the two tribes of gods reconcile through spitting into a vat. Not wanting to discard this token of their truce, they instead create a man out of the spit, calling him \inx[P]{Quasher}; he is so wise that he can answer any question posed to him, and so travels around the world in order to share his wisdom with humans.
Quasher eventually comes to the dwelling of two dwarfs, Fealer and Galer. They kill him and drain his blood into three vessels: two vats named Soon and Bothem, and a kettle named \inx[P]{Woderearer}. Through mixing the blood with honey they make a mead, with the power to turn anyone who drinks from it “a scold or man of learning (\emph{skald eða frǿða-maðr})”. The dwarfs then lie to the Eese about the murder, telling them that Quasher drowned in his own wisdom.
Some time later, the dwarfs murder an ettin named \inx[P]{Gilling} and his wife. Gilling’s son, \inx[P]{Sutting}, learns of this and prepares to drown the dwarfs. In exchange for their lives and as recompense for his father’s slaying, the dwarfs offer Sutting the “dear mead” (\emph{mjǫðinn dýra}; cf. here sts. 105 and 140). Sutting accepts the ransom and takes the mead home with him. He makes his daughter \inx[P]{Guthlathe} guard it.
Some time later, Weden is out journeying, and finds nine thralls mowing hay. He sharpens their scythes with a special whetstone, and the mowing improves greatly. He then throws it in the air and the thralls shortly kill each other over it. By evening Weden comes to the owner of the thralls, Bigh, Sutting’s brother. Bigh laments the death of his workmen, and so Weden, who calls himself \inx[P]{Baleworker}, offers to do the work of the thralls over the summer, in exchange for one drink of Sutting’s mead. Bigh tells him that Sutting alone owns the mead, but that he will accompany Baleworker to Sutting to ask for the drink.
The two arrive at Sutting, who as expected refuses to give any part of the mead away. Baleworker then tells Bigh that he will get to it anyway; he takes out the drill \inx[P]{Rate}, and tells Bigh to drill through the mountain, into the room where the mead is stored. Bigh first attempts to trick him by only drilling halfway, but eventually creates a narrow passage. Baleworker turns himself into a snake and crawls through it; as he does, Bigh tries to strike him the drill, but misses.
After coming through, Baleworker sees Guthlathe watching over the mead. He goes on to sleep with her for three nights, after which she promises him three sips of the mead. With each sip he swallows the contents of one of the three vessels, so that all of the mead ends up in his belly.
Having taken the mead, he dons his eagle-hame and flies away from the mountain. Sutting sees him, takes his own eagle-hame, and gives chase. The Eese see Weden in flight, and set out several large vat on the ground, into which Weden, still flying, spits out the mead. At this point Sutting has almost caught up with him, and so Weden “sends back” (\emph{sęnda aptr}, usually interpreted being sent out from the anus) some of the mead, presumably into his face. This portion becomes the lot of foolish poets (\emph{skald-fífla hlutr}), while the rest of the mead is given to the Eese and to skilled poets (\emph{þęim mǫnnum, er yrkja kunnu} ‘those men who can compose [poetry]’).

The core of this many-twisted myth is old. A close parallel is found in \Rigveda\ hymns 4.26–27. In these two hymns the \emph{soma} plant (who in the Vedic mythology is not just the plant and its resulting drink, but also a god, perhaps somewhat like Quasher) is first held within “a hundred iron forts” (4.27.1c: \emph{śatám púraḥ ā́yasīḥ}) by the archer \emph{Kr̥şānu}, before being stolen by a sweeping falcon. The falcon brings \emph{Soma} to \emph{Manu}, the ancestor of the Aryans and first sacrificer.

The resemblance to the last part of the \Skaldskaparmal\ account should be obvious, but, notably, the detail of the falcon is not found in any of the sts. below. This shows that the narrative of \Skaldskaparmal\ cannot be exclusively based on the sts. here below, but instead also relies on other, now-lost sources. This is also supported by the present sts. leaving out the narratives about Quasher, the two dwarfs, and Baye, along with some subtler narrative differences.

The order of the present sts. follows that of \Regius, their main witness manuscript. The strand begins with some social advice (103), after which the narrative follows (104–110). It is narrated in the first person by Weden himself. The sts. do not tell the myth in chronological order and leave much up to the listener; they are surely composed for an audience that already knows the story. The following narrative details are given:

\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{103}
	\item Weden visits Sutting’s home, but does not receive a good reception.
	\item Guthlate falls in love with Weden, and gives him a drink of the Mead.
	\item Weden has to bore through the mountains with the drill Rate.
	\item Weden has “bought [the Mead] well”; possibly a euphemistic reference to sleeping with Guthlathe for it.
	\item Guthlathe indeed does sleep with Weden, though not expressely in exchange for the Mead.
	\item The following day (\emph{hins hindra dags}, see note to this word in the edited text below), a group of Rime-Thurses come to Weden’s hall, to ask him whether a Baleworker is among the Gods, or if he has been slain by Sutting.
	\item Switching to the third person (which may indicate that this is his answer to the Rime-Thurses), Weden says that he “thinks” that Weden has sworn an oath, but that his words cannot be trusted. After the “simble” (i.e. drinking feast, banquet; probably referring to the drink of the Mead), Weden betrayed Sutting and made Guthlathe weep.
\end{enumerate}

The underlying narrative seems to generally agree with that of \Skaldskaparmal, but unlike its more transactional affair, we here find a stronger emphasis on Weden’s cruel betrayal of Guthlathe. A notable detail not found in \Skaldskaparmal\ is Weden’s oath in st. 109. The content of the oath was most likely that Weden would marry Guthlathe, something supported by the language used (see note to st. 108: \emph{hins hindra dags}). The recipient of the oath, which Weden clearly broke, was either Sutting or Guthlathe. That Weden swore it to Sutting, and thus asked him for Guthlathe’s hand in marriage, may be suggested by the description of Sutting as \emph{svikvinn} ‘betrayed’ in st. 109. This view, however, has an internal narrative problem: in st. 103 Weden describes his interaction with Sutting as poor, and in st. 105 Weden is said to have had to bore through the mountains, but this may just have been to reach Sutting, rather than Guthlathe as in \Skaldskaparmal.
The recipient of the oath being Guthlathe would agree better with the \Skaldskaparmal\ narrative, and Sutting’s betrayer would instead be her.

If we, however, search in the broader Scandinavian sphere, we find in the Swedish provicial laws an exact equivalent of the present phrase, namely OSwe. \emph{hindra-dagher}, a law-word referring specifically to the ‘day after the wedding’, used both on its own and in the expression \emph{hindra-dags gięf} ‘morning gift’.  If this is indeed the sense in the present stanza, two interpretations are possible: it either (i) refers sarcastically to Weden’s sleeping with Guthlathe (as would be done on the wedding night), or (ii) means that Weden actually married, or promised to marry, Guthlathe.

Up shalt thou not look in battle \\

The vowel breaking is however unexpected here, since \emph{gǫltr} (< Proto-Norse \emph{*galtuʀ}) is an u-stem, which makes the stem-vowel in the dat. sg. \emph{gęlti} (< \emph{*galtiu}, cf. \textbf{kunimudiu}, dat. sg. of \emph{*Kunimunduʀ}, on the Tjurkö 1 bracteate) the result of i-umlaut rather than an original short \emph{*e}.

\textcite{LaFargeGlossary} instead explain the word as a borrowing from Old Irish \emph{geilt} ‘insane, mad’. \textcite{PettitEdda} follows this, and argues that the whole theme of the st. probably be of Celtic origin, giving several examples from Celtic literature of warriors going mad upon looking up into the sky during battle. In this case the men (\emph{halir}, which word seems to have an association with warriors; cf. 36–37, 49) would be to quote Pettit some sort of “supernatural sky warriors”, in my opinion most likely the \inx[G]{Oneharriers}.}\evb\evg

\section{The Rune-Tally}

This group of stanzas is introduced by a large initial in \Regius, marking the beginning of a new section.  In younger paper manuscripts they have the header \emph{Rúna-tals þáttr} ‘Strand of the Rune-Tally’, and generally give an archaic, mystic impression; at times one gets a feeling that they were drawn from the lips of an Odinic priest.

Apart from these stanzas there are a few other instances of similar Runic magic.  Closest at hand is st. 80 above, which would fit seamlessly into the present section. Outside of \Havamal\ there is \Sigrdrifumal\ 4–16, also preserved in \Regius.

It mentions \emph{ljóð} ‘leeds; (magical) songs, incantations’ rather than runes, and has nothing to do with Weden’s hanging on the tree. Bestle was Weden’s mother and Balethorn his maternal grandfather. The famous son of Balethorn would then be his maternal uncle. The custom of sending sons away to be fostered by their maternal uncles or grandfathers (which seems to be what is going on here) was quite common in Germanic society, cf. TODO.}\evb\evg

\section{The Leed-Tally (147–165)}

This section of \Havamal, the so-called the Leed-Tally (\emph{Ljóðatal}), is not separated from the preceding section (which is marked out with a large initial), but is usually taken as separate since it is a unified whole not much concerned with runes. The speaker (certainly Weden) recounts eighteen spells, aristocratic and Odinic in character; they deal with such things as healing (spell 2, 12), battle (3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13), countering sorcery (6, 10), stilling the elements (7, 9), and seduction (16, 17).

In particular the fourth spell bears a strong likeness to the first Merseburg charm.

Their original bodies would then be lying in a coma-like state, in something resembling that which is today called astral projection.  Yet, it was not the case that their whole mental faculties would disconnect from their bodies, but rather they would leave behind something of their humanity, which was thought to be inextricably linked to their human bodies.  Weden was through his second sight able to see these riders, and could then use his superior magical skill to confuse them so that they would not be able to return to their human “home”-shapes or minds, but were instead forced to stray as tormented disentagled ghosts; a cruel fate. — Weden likewise brags about tricking riders in \Harbardsljod\ 20.}\evb\evg

\bvb These leeds wilt thou, Loddfathomer, \\
long be lacking! \\
Though they would be good for thee if thou get, \\
useful if thou learn, \\
needful if thou receive.\evb\evg

\bvb I know the eighteenth, which I never teach \\

everything is better when one alone can do it; \\
that follows the end of the leeds— \\
save for her alone who with her arm guards me, \\
or who is my sister.\evb\evg

\bvb Now are the High One’s speeches sung in the High One’s hall; \\
of great use for the sons of men; \\

Hail he who sang; hail he who knows; \\
may he benefit who learned; \\
hail those who heeded!\evb\evg
