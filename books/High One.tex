\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Speeches of the High One} (\Havamal) is the second poem of \Regius, where it follows \Voluspa\ and is followed by \Vafthrudnismal.  \Regius\ is the only mediæval manuscript witness for the whole poem, but several sts. (e.g. 1, 58, 84) are cited in other texts.

\Havamal\ is, as it comes down to us in \Regius, a varied collection.  It contains at least two poems of practical life advice, two mythological narratives, scattered gnomic poetry about runes, and a list of galders.  These materials are chiefly united by their attribution to the god Weden, or as he is called in 109, 111, and 166, the High One.

Following philological tradition I identify the following major strands, excluding various isolated sts. (e.g. 80) that are probably later inserts.  In the present edition each is given its own short introduction:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Guests’ Strand (1–77)
  \item Various scattered sts. of advice (81–90)
  \item Weden’s tryst with Billing’s daughter (91–102)
  \item Weden’s obtaining of the Mead of Poetry (103–110)
  \item The Speeches of Loddfathomer (111–137)
  \item The Rune-tally; sts. about runes and ritual (138–146)
  \item The Leed-tally; Weden’s listing of 18 galders (146–165)
\end{enumerate}

It cannot be claimed for certain that each strand was originally its own poem.  Weden’s two romantic adventures (91–102, 103–110), for instance, have a lot in common stylistically, and seem too short to stand on their own.  On the other hand it seems highly unlikely that the Guests’ Strand and the Speeches of Loddfathomer were originally part of the same work.  They differ greatly in tone—the former being down to earth and irreligious, the latter putting much emphasis on magical or even superstitious ideas; in style—the former never making use of the second imperative, the latter very frequently; and in coherence—the former having a perfectly fitting conclusion in sts. 76–77, the latter being much more varied.  There is also some repetition between them (most notably st. 119), which would have been quite redundant if both were originally a single work.

Since the full \Havamal, then, appears to consist of at least a few originally separate compositions, two questions naturally arise: \emph{how} were these materials redacted into a single poem, and \emph{why}?  Any answers must needs be speculative, and so the following is only my speculation.

To answer either question, we first need to determine in what context the redaction took place; whether in an oral or scribal tradition, in a Heathen hove or a Catholic monastery.  St. 166, given that it explicitly mentions the title of the poem, must probably be associated with the final layer of the redaction, and is thus of particular use.  Its blessing of reciter, hearers, and learners indicates that the poem was to be chanted and learned by heart, and its description of the contents of the poem (which includes unambiguous Heathen ritual advice like st. 145) as \emph{all-þǫrf} ‘most useful’ to Men and \emph{ȯ-þǫrf} ‘harmful’ to Ettins invokes the Heathen dichotomy between the Gods and Ettins as friends and enemies of Mankind, respectively.  With this in mind, the poem was probably redacted into something very close to its present form no later than the early 11th century, in an oral, Heathen context.

Moving on to the \emph{how}, it is certain that in an oral transmission additions and inserts need not have happened all at once, but could have taken place successively in the form of layers appended to an original core.  Thus the original Guests’ Strand probably ended at st. 77, but sts. 78–90 may have been added shortly afterwards, later the two narratives about Weden’s romantic escapades, thereafter the Speeches of Loddfathomer, the Rune-tally, and the Leeds.  Even after the basic structure was obtained, stanzas such as 73 could have been inserted where they were felt most fitting in order to make the poem more “complete” in the eyes of the inserter.  These inserts may well have continued into the period of scribal transmission.

For the \emph{why}, we should consider what reason someone would have for redacting numerous materials into a single poem.  St. 166, as discussed above, suggests that the main reason was utilitarian rather than antiquarian, and a picture then emerges of a redactor arranging a corpus of traditional poetry, selected both for its traditional attribution to the god Weden and for its \emph{usefulness}—whether as practical life advice or as mythological and religious lore—into a single long poem meant to be learned by heart as a whole and recited for magical purposes.  In practice this final redaction served as sort of Odinic “ark” (or “Hoardmimer’s wood”) in which the bulk of surviving pre-Christian Norse advice poetry was transmitted until it could be written down.  Forever lost were whichever stanzas were not included in it—and many such must have existed.

\section{The Guests’ Strand (1–79)}

The Guests’ Strand (Old Norse: \emph{Gęsta-þáttr}) is a wisdom poem, taking its outset in the scenario of a lone wanderer’s arriving as a stranger at a farmstead.  It begins by discussing the mutual responsibilites between guest and host, before moving on to describing proper conduct in broader human interactions with a particular focus on drinking, speech, and friendship.

While there are some fine transitions employed in order to move from one theme to another (e.g. between sts. 4–5, or 10–11), there is no clear division into thematic sections, and previous subjects often appear again after having been dropped for a few stanzas.  The spirit of the advice is in any case very consistent throughout, and the poem at all turns advices caution and shrewdness.  Of particular importance is the idea of “manwit” (ON \emph{man-vit}), a word somewhat analogous with the English “common sense” or “street wisdom”.

It seems very likely that the original Guests’ Strand ended at st. 77.  This finds strong support in \Hakonarmal\ 21, the final st. of that poem, which likewise begins with the first two lines \emph{dęyr fé \hld\ dęyja frę́ndr}.

The form \emph{-sall} lacks i-umlaut due to a shortening of the vowel before the umlaut became phonemic; the ancestral Proto-Norse form would be \emph{*wajē-sāliʀ}, for which cf. ᚹᚨᛃᛖ-ᛗᚨᚱᛁᛉ \emph{wajē-mariʀ} ‘infamous’ on the Tjurkö bracteate, where the second element is the ancestor of ON \emph{mę́rr} ‘renowned, famous’; the expected descendant \emph{*ve-marr} is not attested. — I translate \emph{sę́ll} as ‘blessed’, but it is not a past participle and could also be rendered as ‘lucky’ or ‘blissful’.  It carries a certain sense of innateness that is foreign to modern Western culture; thus a king whose land experiences bountiful harvests (\emph{ár}) is said to be \emph{ár-sę́ll} ‘blessed with harvests’, while one whose kingdom is at peace (\emph{friðr}) is said to be \emph{frið-sę́ll} ‘blessed with peace’.  In this worldview the state of the realm is not due to uncontrollable environmental or political factors, but rather arises from the kingly person himself.

{\small It is likely that the original Guests’ Strand ended here, and this is supported by the fact that the 10th c. \Hakonarmal\ begins its very last stanza with \emph{dęyr fé \hld\ dęyja frę́ndr}, probably alluding to the last stanzas of the Guests’ Strand poem.  The three following stanzas, 78–80, especially 80, are poorly placed and seem like later inserts.}

{\small In \Regius\ the following two sts. come in the opposite order, but it seems probable from its \Malahattr\ meter and the dative case of the words that 89 should follow 87.  On the other hand st. 88, with its \Ljodahattr\ meter and self-enclosed form seems a separate composition, and was probably inserted after 87 due to its first line (\emph{akri ár-sǫ́num}), which is also in the dative.}

\section{Weden’s tryst with Billing’s daughter (91–102)}

The following two groups of sts. (91–102, 103–110) are united by their meter, \Ljodahattr\ (unlike most of the preceding sts.), style, and content; both concern Weden’s romantic adventures.

The first strand begins with general maxims about love and relations between the sexes, before moving on to the narrative about Billing’s daughter.  Billing is an entirely unknown figure, as is his daughter. All attempts to connect this myth to natural phenomena or heroic ballads have been unconvincing and ultimately fruitless.

\section{Weden’s theft of the Mead of Poetry (103–110)}

These stanzas concern Weden’s theft of the Mead of Poetry from the ettin Sutting.  The same myth is laid out fully in \Skaldskaparmal\ 5–6, which goes as follows, with minor details left out:

	{\small After the war between the Eese and Wanes, the two tribes of gods reconcile through spitting into a vat. Not wanting to discard this token of their truce, they instead make a man out of the spit and call him \inx[P]{Quasher}.  He is so wise that he can answer any question posed to him, and so he travels around the world in order to share his learning with men.

	Quasher eventually comes to the dwelling of two dwarfs, Fealer and Galer. They kill him and drain his blood into three vessels: two vats named Soon and Bothem, and a kettle named \inx[P]{Woderearer}. They mix the blood into honey, and from this they make a mead which can make whomever drinks from it “a scold or man of learning (\emph{skald eða frǿða-maðr})”.  The dwarfs lie to the Eese about the murder, telling them that Quasher drowned in his own wisdom for a lack of good questions.

	Some time later, the dwarfs murder the ettin \inx[P]{Gilling} and his wife. Gilling’s son, \inx[P]{Sutting}, learns of this and prepares to drown the dwarfs. In exchange for their lives and as weregild for his parents, the dwarfs offer Sutting the “dear mead” (\emph{mjǫð’inn dýra}; cf. here sts. 105 and 140). Sutting accepts the payment and takes the mead home with him. He places his daughter \inx[P]{Guthlathe} in a cave to guard it.}

	{\small Chapter 6 continues as Weden is wandering through the world.  He finds nine thralls mowing hay and lends them aid by sharpening their scythes with a special whetstone.  They now cut much faster.  He throws the whetstone in the air and the greedy thralls fight to the death over it, leaving none alive.  By evening Weden comes to the owner of the thralls, Baye, Sutting’s brother.  Baye laments the death of his workmen, and so Weden, calling himself \inx[P]{Baleworker}, offers to do their work over the summer in exchange for one drink of the mead.  Baye tells him that Sutting alone owns the mead, but that he will accompany him to Sutting’s to ask.

	In autumn the two arrive at Sutting’s, who expectedly refuses to give any part of the mead away.  Weden then tells Baye that he will get to it anyway.  He takes out the drill \inx[P]{Rate} and tells Baye to drill through the mountains into the cave where the mead is stored. Baye first attempts to trick him by only drilling halfway through, but eventually creates a narrow passage. Weden turns himself into a snake and crawls through it; as he does, Baye tries to strike him with the drill, but misses.

	On the other side Weden finds Guthlathe watching over the mead.  He seduces her, and she promises him three sips of the mead in exchange for sleeping with her for three nights.  Weden sleeps with her and then drinks.  With each sip he swallows the contents of one of the three vessels, so that all of the mead ends up in his belly.

	Having drunk the mead, he dons his eagle-hame and flies away from the mountain.  Sutting sees him, takes his own eagle-hame, and gives chase.  The Eese see the chase overhead and set out several large vats on the ground, into which Weden, still flying, spits out the mead. At this point Sutting has almost caught up with him, and so Weden “sends back” (\emph{sęnda aptr}, viz. from behind) some of the mead, presumably into Sutting’s face.

	The mead in the vats is given to the Eese and to skilled poets (\emph{þęim mǫnnum, er yrkja kunnu} ‘those men who can compose verse’), and the portion which was “sent back” becomes the lot of foolish poets (\emph{skald-fífla hlutr}).}

The narrative core most likely goes back to the Bronze Age, for a close parallel is found in the Vedic myth of the origin of the ritual drink \emph{Sóma} which in the Vedic mythology is not just the plant and its resulting drink, but also a god in its own right.  The earliest version is found in the two hymns \Rigveda\ 4.26 and 27, in which the \emph{Sóma} is held inside “a hundred bronze forts” (4.27.1c: \emph{şatám púras ā́yasīs}) by the archer \emph{Kr̥şā́nu}, but is stolen by a sweeping, mighty Eagle who brings it to \emph{Mánu}, the first human sacrificer and ancestor of the Aryans.  \emph{Kr̥şā́nu} does not himself give chase, but does shoot his arrows at the Eagle, missing.

Vedic texts outside of \Rigveda\ clearly identify the Eagle with Agní, the god of fire, specifically in the form of the \emph{gāyatrī́} meter \parencite{Bloomfield1896}.  One text in particular (\AitareyaBrahmana\ 3.25–27) is interesting in its etiological function: “What (the \emph{gāyatrī}) seized with her right foot, that became the morning pressure (\emph{prātaḥsavana}). \dots\ What she seized with her left foot became the noon pressure (\emph{mādhyaṁdinaṁ savanam}). \dots\ What she seized became the third pressure (\emph{tṛtīyam savanam}).” \parencite[6]{Bloomfield1896}.  \citeauthor{Bloomfield1896} further offers a naturalistic explanation of the myth, namely that the Eagle—Agní in the form of lightning—shoots forth “from the womb of the cloud; as the lightning shoots from the cloud, the heavenly fluid, the Soma, streams down upon the earth.”

Now onto the present stanzas.  The biggest difference between \Skaldskaparmal\ 5–6 and \Havamal\ 103–110 is that \Havamal\ is very far from a linear retelling of events, and on its own the narrative thread is actually quite difficult to follow.

The most important detail shared between \Skaldskaparmal\ and the Vedic hymns—the eagle—is not found in \Havamal.  Other important \Skaldskaparmal\ elements not found in the present stanzas are Quasher, the two dwarfs, and Baye, and it is thus made clear that Snorre’s narrative cannot be exclusively based on \Havamal, but must also rely on other, now-lost sources.  That this is indeed the case is proven by the large number of kennings for poetry found in the Scaldic poetry, which reference Quasher’s blood, the two dwarfs, the eagle’s flight and its “sending back” of a certain part of the mead \parencite[427--430]{Meissner1921}, the last one being expressed through kennings like Þstf Lv 3 (\Skp\ II) \emph{lęirr ara ins gamla} ‘dung of the ancient eagle \ken{bad poetry}’.

On the other hand there are elements found in \Havamal\ which do not appear in \Skaldskaparmal, and the focus of the stanzas is squarely on Weden’s visit to Sutting, particularly on his betrayal him and his daughter, Guthlathe, which contrasts with the transactional three-night affair seen in \Skaldskaparmal.  It is possible that the version underlying \Havamal\ even had Weden marry Guthlathe, thereby receiving the mead as a dowry.  This is supported by the expression \emph{hins hindra dags} (st. 109), and would explain Weden’s oath (st. 110).  The recipient of the oath may even have been Sutting, the father of the bride, as suggested by the description of him as \emph{svikvinn} ‘betrayed’ and by the fact that he perhaps hosted a banquet for Weden (st. 110), although an internal problem with that view is that Weden is still said to have had to bore through the mountains (st. 107), presumably to reach Guthlathe, in which case it comes off as unlikely that he would \emph{then} have asked Sutting for her hand, rather than simply seducing her then-and-there in her chamber.  See further notes to the relevant stanzas.

The present sts. are ordered according to \Regius, the only mediæval witness manuscript.  They begin with some social advice (103), after which the narrative follows (104–110), retold in the first person by Weden himself. The sts. do not tell the myth in chronological order and leave much up to the listener; they are clearly composed for an audience that already knows the story.%  The following details are given:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\setcounter{enumi}{103}
%	\item Weden visits Sutting’s home, but does not receive a good reception.
%	\item Guthlate falls in love with Weden, and gives him a drink of the Mead.
%	\item Weden has to bore through the mountains with the drill Rate.
%	\item Weden has “bought [the Mead] well”; possibly a euphemistic reference to sleeping with Guthlathe for it.
%	\item Guthlathe indeed does sleep with Weden, though not expressely in exchange for the Mead.
%	\item “The following day” a group of Rime-Thurses come to Weden’s hall to ask him whether a Baleworker is among the Gods, or if he has been slain by Sutting.
%	\item Switching to the third person (which may indicate that this is his answer to the Rime-Thurses), Weden says that he “thinks” that Weden has sworn an oath, but that his words cannot be trusted. After the “simble” Weden betrayed Sutting and made Guthlathe weep.

\section{The Speeches of Loddfathomer (111–137)}

The so-called \textbf{Speeches of Loddfathomer} (ON \emph{Loddfáfnismǫ́l}) is a series of advice stanzas addressed to \inx[P]{Loddfathomer}, an otherwise unknown figure who is clearly fictional.  His name is a compound: the first element, \emph{lodd-}, is related to ON \emph{loddari} ‘juggler, tramp’, OE \emph{loddere} ‘pauper, beggar’, and the second, \emph{Fáfnir} (\inx[P]{Fathomer}), is the name of the famous \inx[C]{wyrm} which literally means ‘embracer’.  The name paints the picture of an archetypal greedy fool in desperate need of the wisdom taught by Weden, his intellectual superior.  Loddfathomer reappears in st. 164, but is not found anywhere outside of \Havamal.

The content of the advice is often identical to that found in the Guests’ Strand (1–79) above, but on the other hand some items have a noticably superstitious or religious character, something generally absent in 1–79.

In \Regius\ stanza 111 has a noticably larger initial \emph{M}, albeit smaller than the initials which introduce new chapters and poems.

(1) \CV\ explains it as an old dative of \emph{gǫltr} ‘boar, hog’.  This neccessitates an irregular breaking of \emph{ja} < \emph{ę}, since \emph{gǫltr} (< Proto-Norse \emph{*galtuʀ}) is an u-stem and should have dat. sg. \emph{gęlti} (< \emph{*galtiu}, cf. \textbf{kunimudiu}, dat. sg. of \emph{*Kunimunduʀ}, on the Tjurkö 1 bracteate).  (2) The generally accepted explanation in modern scholarship seems to be a borrowing from Old Irish \emph{geilt} ‘insane, mad’ (so \textcite{LaFargeGlossary} and others).  The closest parallel to the present stanza is the C12th or 13th Gaelic tale of Suibhne mac Colmáin, who was cursed by saint Rónán Finn to become mad; the curse took effect when he looked into the sky during a battle, after which he was known as Suibhne geilt.  Earlier versions of the same story are attested as early as the 840s \parencite[100]{Males2024}.}\evb\evg

\section{The Rune-Tally (138–146)}

This group of stanzas is introduced by a large initial in \Regius, marking the beginning of a new section.  In younger paper manuscripts they have the header \emph{Rúna-tals þáttr} ‘Strand of the Rune-Tally’, and generally give an ancient, mystical impression; at times one gets a feeling that they were drawn from the lips of an Odinic priest.

Apart from these stanzas there are a few other manuscript attestations of similar Runic magic.  Closest at hand is st. 80 above, which would fit seamlessly into the present section.  Outside of \Havamal\ there is \Sigrdrifumal\ 5–17, also preserved in \Regius.

\section{The Leed-Tally (147–165)}

This section of \Havamal, the so-called the Leed-Tally (\emph{Ljóðatal}), is not separated from the preceding section (which is marked out with a large initial), but is usually taken as separate since it is a self-contained list not much concerned with runes.  The speaker, Weden, addressing Loddfathomer, lists eighteen galders or spells he knows.  The spells themselves are not given; only their purpose.  They are aristocratic and Odinic in character and deal with such things as battle (3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13), healing (galder 2, 12), countering sorcery (6, 10), controlling the elements (7, 9), and seduction (16, 17).  The eighteenth and last spell is a mystery; not even its purpose is told, and it is known only by Weden and his closest women.

There is a clear relation to other known Germanic galders.  The fourth bears a strong likeness to \Grougaldr\ 10, and its effect (removing fetters) is shared with the High German \MerseburgOne, an actual galder of that type.  The mysterious eighteenth spell finds an interesting parallel in the unknowable eighteenth question posed by Weden in \Vafthrudnismal\ 54.
