\bookStart{Fragments from the Saw of the Walsings}

In \Regius\ \Sigrdrifumal\ is followed by the famous “great lacuna”.  Numerous pages are missing, and with them much poetry about Siward.  The author of the \VolsungaSaga\ had access to and drew from a manuscript collection of Eddic poetry closely related to \Regius.  He quotes many stanzas known to us from \Regius, but also some which are not found in the extant copy—these are edited here.  The following stanzas in \VolsungaSaga\ occur at the part of the narrative which would have been found on the lost pages of \Regius, and so it is likely that some or all of them derive from longer poems found there.

the flame all lowered before the praise-eager man; \\
the harness flashed, which Rein had owned.\evb\evg
