\bookStart{Introduction to Old Saxon Christian Poetry}

The forced conversion of the Saxons to Christianity under Charlemagne was a notably violent process.

The two poems edited here—\Heliand\ and \SaxonGenesis—form the totality of the Old Saxon poetic corpus.  Both are thoroughly Christian, and although written in the language of traditional epic, apparently for a noble audience, they launch a pointed Christian attack on the Old Germanic warrior worldview.

Before the two poems I present the \textbf{Old Saxon Baptismal Vow} as an important piece of historical context.
