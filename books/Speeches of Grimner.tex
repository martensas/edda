\bookStart{The Speeches of Grimner}[Grímnismǫ́l]

% Introduction


The \textbf{Speeches of Grimner} are preserved whole in both \Regius\ and \AM.

The structure of the poem is mostly clear; the first three verses set the stage, repeating some of what we got in the prose. It is certain that Weden is the speaker. After this various lore is touched on, not always clearly. In this the poem aligns closely with ones such as \Vafthrudnismal\, \Sigrdrifumal\ and \Allvismal.

First are listed the halls of the gods (4–17), though the numbering does not seem to agree with the count of locations mentioned. Then the conditions and surroundings of Weden’s animals and hall are elaborated on (18–23). Mentioned are the preparation of food (18), his wolves (19) and ravens (20), the river through which dead men have to wade (21), the gate through which they have to pass (22), the count of doors in the hall (23) and the two animals who gnaw on the branches of the tree (25–26). We then have a long list of rivers (28–30) and horses ridden by the gods (31). Then is told of the conditions and animals of Ugdrassle (32–36).

Thereafter follow several discordant verses. A list of Walkirries (37), the progression of the sun and moon (38–40), the creation of the world from Yimer’s body (41–42), the significance of \inx{bloot-kettles}[C] (43), the creation of the ship Shidebladner (44) and finally the noblest of several categories of things and groups (45).

After all of this Weden utters an unclear verse invoking the gods (46), before listing many of his names and the circumstances in which they were used (47–50). He then turns to Garfrith, disappointed by the inhospitality and poor conduct of his former protégé, and predicts his imminent death (51–53). He finally reveals himself by his true name, daring Garfrith to face him (53). After this he repeats several of his names (54), and the poetry ends.

In the final prose section we are told that Garfrith tripped and fell on his sword, after which is son Eyner rules for a long time.

\bva Hęitr est hripuðr \hld\ ok hęldr til mikill, &

Loði sviðnar, \hld\ þótt á lopt bera'k; &

\bvb Hot art thou, flame, and rather too large; go far from me, fire! The woolen cape is singed though I hold it aloft; the cloak burns before me.\evb

nema ęinn Agnarr, \hld\ es ęinn skal ráða, &
Gęirrøðar sonr, \hld\ Gotna landi.\eva

\bvb For eight nights sat I between the fires here, while no man offered me food; save for lone Eyner, who lone shall rule—the son of Garfrith—the land of the Gots!\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Hęill skalt, Agnarr, \hld\ alls hęilan biðr &

\bvb Yewdales are called where Woulder has made himself a hall. Elfham to Free in days of yore the Tues as a tooth-gift\footnoteB{The gift that a child receives when he gets his first tooth.} gave.

ęn nú Skaði byggvir, \hld\ skír brúðr goða, &
\ind fornar toptir fǫður.\eva

\bvb Thrimham is called the sixth, where Thedse dwelled, that terrifying ettin; but now Scathe bedwells—pure bride of the gods—the ancient plots of her father.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Bręiðablik eru hin sjaundu, \hld\ ęn þar Baldr hęfir &

\bvb Andrimner lets in Eldrimner Sowrimner be boiled. The best of pork, but few know it, by what the Ownharriers are nourished.\footnoteB{The cook Andrimner ‘face-sooty’ has the boar Sowrimner ‘sow-sooty’ boiled in the cauldron Eldrimner ‘fire-sooty’; by this meat are the Ownharriers nouished.}\evb

\bvb \inx{Thound}[P] roars; dwells Thedwitner’s fish\footnoteB{A very difficult kenning to interpret, but see TODO.} in the flood; the river-stream seems far too great, for the noisy slain host to wade through.\footnoteB{Presumably describing the river which surrounds Walhall, and which the dead have to pass on their way to it.}\evb

\bvg
\bva Ór Ymis holdi \hld\ vas jǫrð of skǫpuð, &

\bvb The favour of Woulder, and of all the Ease, has each who first touches the fire; for the Homes become open about the sons of the Ease, when the cauldrons are lifted off.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ívalda synir \hld\ gingu í árdaga &
\ind Skíðblaðni at skapa, &

ǫllum ęinhęrjum \hld\ ok Óðins hylli. \eva

\bvb Worse for ale art thou, Garfrith, hast thou too much drunk. Of much art thou bereft, as thou art of my support, of all the Ownharriers, and of Weden’s favour.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Fjǫlð þér sagðak, \hld\ ęn þú fátt of mant, &
\ind of þik véla vinir;
mę́ki liggja \hld\ sé’k míns vinar &
\ind allan í dręyra drifinn.\eva

\bvb Much I told thee, but thou recallest little; ’tis friends that deal with thee. The sword I see, of my friend, lying all drenched in gore.\footnoteB{Weden predicts Garfrith’s imminent death.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ęggmóðan val \hld\ nú mun Yggr hafa, &

Ófnir ok Sváfnir \hld\ hygg at orðnir sé &
\ind allir at ęinum mér.\eva

\bvb Weden I am now called, Ug was I earlier called; I called myself Thound before that. Wacker and Shelfing, Waved and Roft-Tue, Geat and Gelding among the gods. Ofner and Sweefner, I ween, are become all for the one me.\evb
\evg


Geirröðr konungr sat ok hafði sverð um kné sér ok brugðit til miðs. En er hann heyrði at Óðinn var þar kominn stóð hann upp ok vildi taka Óðin frá eldinum. Sverðit slapp ór hendi hánum; vissu hjöltin niðr. Konungr drap fę́ti ok steyptiz áfram en sverðit stóð í gögnum hann ok fekk {hann}{þar af \AM} bana. {Óðinn hvarf þá.}{\emph{om.} \AM} En Agnarr {var þar}{varð \AM} konungr {lengi síðan.}{\emph{om.} \AM}

King Garfrith sat and had a sword about his knee, and it was brandished half-way up. But when he heard that Weden was come there, he stood up and would take Weden from the fire. The sword slipped out of his hand; the hilt pointed downwards. The king tripped and threw himself forth, but the sword pierced him, and he received his bane. Weden then disappeared, but Eyner was there king for a long while thence.
