\section{Introduction}

This text can be split into two parts, the poem and the prayer. Following my principle of including sources rather than excluding (TODO: see Introduction), I here present both.

The first part is a short alliterative poem describing the earliest beginning of the world. The poet describes “the greatest of wonders”, namely that the universe began as a void, where neither earth nor heaven existed. In this void was, however, the almighty God, along with his many spirits (presumably the Heavenly Host or the Angels). While the cosmogony expressed is clearly Jewish-Christian rather than Germanic, the poem does contain two word-pairs also found in Norse Heathen stanzas about the creation of the world (see Notes to ll. 2, 3.), which may point toward a repurposing of older Heathen motifs and expressions in the new, Christian context.

The second part is a thoroughly Christian prayer. The author first thanks God for creating the earth and heaven, this is presumably why the poem was included, and for giving good things to mankind. He then asks for faith, strength and wisdom to help him in his mission.

\bvb I have learned among men that greatest of wonders, \\
that earth was not nor up-heaven, \\
nor wood nor mountain was not, \\
nor any [...]; nor did the sun shine, \\
nor the moon give off light, nor the glittering sea. \\
Then there was no kind of end or border, \\
and then was the One Almighty God, \\
the Mildest of Men \ken*{= Christ}, and there were also many with Him: \\
good ghosts, and Holy God.\evb\evg

\bpb O God almighty! Thou didst work heaven and earth and Thou didst give men so much good.
Give me in Thy mercy right belief and good will; wisdom and foresight and power to withstand devils and to reproach queerness and to work thy will.\epb\epg
