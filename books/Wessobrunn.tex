\section{Introduction}

The so-called \textbf{Wessobrunn Hymn} is found in a late C8th Bavarian manuscript with the Latin heading \emph{De poeta} ‘By the poet’.  The text was divided by the scribe into three parts, each introduced by a capital letter adorned with dots of red ink.  The first two parts are poetic (“the poem”), and the third is in prose (“the prayer”).

The poem consists of 9 long-lines in alliterative meter, detailing the earliest beginning of the world.  The first five lines describe “the greatest of wonders”, namely that the universe was once void, without earth or heaven, wood or mountain, sun or moon or sea.  These lines are very similar to pre-Christian Norse stanzas about the creation of the world, and in fact contain formulaic word-pairs also found in those stanzas (see Notes to ll. 2, 3), suggesting a repurposing of older Heathen motifs and expressions in the new, Christian context.  With this in mind, the latter four lines constitute a subversion of the earlier Heathen tradition, by placing in this early emptiness the Almighty God, Jesus Christ, and His many ghosts—presumably the Heavenly Host or the Angels.  This is the Christian creation \emph{ex nihilo}, rather than the Indo-European creation through sacrifice of a primordial being (see Note to \Vafthrudnismal\ 21, \Grimnismal\ 41–42).

The prayer is in prose.  The speaker first thanks God for creating the earth and heaven—this is presumably why the poem was included—and for giving boons to mankind.  He then asks for faith, strength, and wisdom to help him in his mission.
