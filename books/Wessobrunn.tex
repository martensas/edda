This text can be split into two parts, the “poem” and the “prayer”. Following my principle of including rather than excluding sources (TODO: see Introduction), I here present both.

The first part is a short alliterative poem describing the earliest beginning of the world. The poem first describes “the greatest wonder”, namely that the universe began with total emptiness—neither earth nor heaven existed. In this emptiness, however, was the almighty God, along with his many spirits, presumably the Heavenly Host, the Angels. While it clearly expresses the Jewish-Christian cosmogony rather than the Germanic, the poem does contain two word-pairs also found in Norse Heathen stanzas about the creation of the world. These may hint toward a Heathen influence, with the poet repurposing Heathen motifs for a Christian context.

The second part is a thoroughly Christian prayer. The author first thanks God for creating the earth and heaven, this is presumably why the poem was included, and for giving good things to mankind. He then asks for faith, strength and wisdom to “withstand devils”, “reproach degeneracy” and “work [God’s] will”.

\bvb I learned among men that greatest of wonders, \\
that earth was not, nor up-heaven, \\
nor a tree, nor a crag was not, \\
nor any [...]; nor did the sun shine, \\
nor the moon give off light, nor the glittering sea. \\
Then there was nothing, TODO,— \\
and then was the one almighty god: \\
the mildest of men \ken*{= Christ}, and there were also many with him: \\
good spirits, and holy god.\evb

\bpb God almighty, thou didst work heaven and earth, and didst grant men so many good things;
grant me in thy mercy the right belief, and good will; wisdom and prophecy, and power to withstand devils and to reproach degeneracy and to work thy will.\epb
