\textbf{Meter:} \Fornyrdislag\ with hendings in the b-verses
\end{flushright}%

A standing stone inscribed on one side with a large cross.  Already on the earliest depictions the stone was damaged, but an even larger part has now gone missing.  Other stones that mention \inx[L]{Longbeardland} (Lombardy) include TODO...  The meter is highly unusual for runic Swedish poetry, relying on hendings (in line 2 an ethel-hending \emph{arð- : barð-}, in line 3 a shot-hending \emph{land- : ęnd-}).  Line 2b is formulaic; see note.

The couplet at the end, expressing a father’s grief for his son, also serves as a good example of the Wiking Age preoccupation with the End Times.  The stone is decorated with a cross, but the text has no signs of Christian influence, and the language is traditional.

Cf. especially Arn \emph{Hryn} 3/7–8 (in \Skp\ 2, see also note there): \emph{meiri verði þinn an þeira \hld\ þrifnuðr allr, und’s himinn rifnar.} ‘greater than theirs may all thy wealth be until heaven rends.’

A standing stone inscribed on one side.  There is no cross present, but a large four-legged beast with a long tail.  The stone is heavily damaged, but mostly readable, except for what is here taken to be the half of line 2, which is entirely lost.  The expression is formulaic; cf. Sm 39, Sm 44, Sö 130, U 739, and U 805.  For “\inx[C]{good of meat}”, which also occurs in \textlink{Havamal}; see Index.  The first line is not poetic.

A standing stone inscribed on one side, with a large cross present.  There are no major difficulties with the reading.  The expression is formulaic; cf. Sm 39, Sm 44, Sö 130, U 703, and U 805.  “mild of meat” appears to be a variant of “\inx[C]{good of meat}”, which also occurs in \textlink{Havamal}; see Index.  The first line is not poetic.  For other stones raised by someone in memory of themselves, see TODO.

The stone has been lost, and only survives in old depictions, which makes the reading, especially two of the personal names, uncertain.  My transliteration follows Rundata.

The expression is formulaic; cf. Sm 39, Sm 44, Sö 130, U 703, and U 739.  For “\inx[C]{good of meat}”, which also occurs in \textlink{Havamal}; see Index.  The first line is not poetic.
