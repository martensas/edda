\bvg\bva „Vaki mę́r męyja, \hld\ vaki mín vina, &
Hyndla systir, \hld\ es í hęlli býr; &
nú ’s røkr røkra, \hld\ ríða vit skulum &
til Valhallar \hld\ ok til vés hęilags.\eva

\bvb {[Frow quoth:]} “Wake, O maiden of maidens; wake, my friend, \\
sister Hindle, who lives in the rock-face! \\
Now is the twilight of twilights; we two shall ride \\
to Walhall, and to the holy \inx[C]{wigh}!\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Biðjum Hęrjafǫðr \hld\ í hugum sitja, &
hann geldr ok gefr \hld\ gull \edtrans{verðugum}{to the worthy}{\Afootnote{emended to \emph{verðungu} ‘to the retinue’ by \textcite{FinnurEdda}, \textcite{GudniEdda}}}, &
gaf hann Hęrmóði \hld\ hjalm ok brynju, &
en Sigmundi \hld\ sverð at þiggja.\eva

\bvb Let us bid the Father of Hosts \name{= Weden} to remain in good spirits;  \\
he rewards and gives gold to the worthy.  \\
He gave \inx[P]{Harmod} helmet and byrnie, \\
and \inx[P]{Syemund} a sword to receive.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Gefr hann \alst{s}igr \alst{s}onum, \hld\ en \alst{s}vinnum aura, &
\alst{m}ę́lsku \alst{m}ǫrgum \hld\ ok \alst{m}an-vit firum, &
\alst{b}yri gefr \alst{b}rǫgnum, \hld\ en \alst{b}rag skǫldum, &
gefr hann \alst{m}ann-sęmi \hld\ \alst{m}ǫrgum rekki.\eva

\bvb He gives victory to sons and silver to the wise, \\
speech to many and \inx[C]{manwit} to men. \\
Fair wind he gives to nobles and praise-song to \inx[C]{scald}[scalds]; \\
he gives manly valour to many a champion.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva \alst{Þ}ór mun’k blóta, \hld\ \alst{þ}ess mun’k biðja, &
at hann \alst{ę́} við þik \hld\ \alst{ęi}n-art láti; &
þó ’s hǫ́num \alst{ȯ}-títt \hld\ við \alst{jǫ}tuns brúðir.\eva

\bvb To Thunder I will \inx[C]{bloot}; of this I will bid, \\
that he always be upright with thee \\
even though he hates the ettin’s brides.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Nú tak-tu \alst{u}lf þinn \hld\ \alst{ęi}nn af stalli, &
lát hann \alst{r}inna \hld\ með \alst{r}una mínum.“— &
„Sęinn es \alst{g}ǫltr þinn \hld\ \alst{g}oð-veg troða, &
vil’k-at \alst{m}ar \alst{m}ínn \hld\ \alst{m}ę́tan hlǿða.\eva

\bvb Now take thy one wolf from the stable; \\
let him run alongside my boar.”— \\
{[Hindle quoth:]} “Slow is thy boar to tread the Godways; \\
I will not load my noble steed.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Flǫ́ est Fręyja, \hld\ es fręistar mín, &
\edtext{vísar þú augum \hld\ á oss þannig, &
es hafir ver þinn \hld\ í val-sinni}{\lemma{vísar \dots\ val-sinni ‘thou showest \dots\ slain-ways’}\Bfootnote{i.e., “You only show favour to me because you want me to help your lover”.  For the expression cf. \Sigrdrifumal\ 3/3 and note.}} &
Óttar unga \hld\ Innstęins bur.“\eva

\bvb False art thou, Frow, who temptest me; \\
thou showest thy eyes on us this way \\
since thou hast thy lover on the slain-ways: \\
the young Oughter, Instone's offspring.”\evb\evg


\bvg\bva „Dulið est Hyndla, \hld\ draums ę́tla’k þér, &
es kveðr ver minn \hld\ í valsinni.\eva

\bvb {[Frow quoth:]}%
Deluded art thou, Hindle; I think thee dreamy \\
as thou sayest that my man is on the slain-ways.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Þar’s gǫltr glóar \hld\ Gullinbursti, &
\edtext{Hildisvíni}{\lemma{Hildisvíni ‘Hildswine’}\Bfootnote{Presumably an alternative name of Goldenbristle.}}, \hld\ es mér hagir gęrðu, &
dvergar tvęir \hld\ Dáinn ok Nabbi.\eva

\bvb There where the boar Goldenbristle glows, \\
the Hildswine, which the two skillful dwarfs \\
Dowen and Nab did make for me.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Sęnn í sǫðlum \hld\ sitja vit skulum &
ok of jǫfra \hld\ ę́ttir dǿma, &
gumna þęira, \hld\ es frá goðum kómu.\eva

\bvb Soon in the saddles we two shall sit, \\
and speak about the lineages of princes, \\
of those men who are come from the gods.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Þęir hafa vęðjat \hld\ vala malmi &
Óttarr ungi \hld\ ok Angantýr; &
skylt ’s at vęita, \hld\ svá’t skati hinn ungi & &
fǫður-lęifð hafi \hld\ ępt frę́ndr sína.\eva

\bvb They have wagered the Welsh ore \ken{gold}, \\
young Oughter and Ongenthew— \\
it \emph{must} be divulged, so that the young prince \\
may have the patrimony left by his kinsmen.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Hǫrg hann mér gęrði \hld\ hlaðinn stęinum; &
nú ’s grjót þat \hld\ at glęri orðit; &
rauð hann í nýju \hld\ nauta blóði; &
ę́ trúði Óttarr \hld\ á ǫ́synjur.\eva

\bvb A \inx[C]{harrow} he made for me, loaded with stones; \\
now that stone-pile has turned into glass. \\
He reddened it in the fresh blood of oxen; \\
always did Oughter trust on the \inx[G]{Ossens}.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Nú lát forna \hld\ niðja talða &
ok upp-bornar \hld\ ę́ttir manna &
hvat ’s Skjǫldunga, \hld\ hvat ’s Skilfinga, &
hvat ’s Ǫðlinga \hld\ hvat ’s Ylfinga & &
hvat ’s hǫld-borit, \hld\ hvat ’s hęrs-borit &
męst manna val \hld\ und Mið-garði?“\eva

\bvb Now let ancient kinsmen be counted, \\
and the high born lineages of men: \\
What is of the Shieldings? What is of the Shilvings? \\
What is of the Athlings? What is of the Wolvings? \\
What is born of hero? What is born of chief, \\
the mightiest choice of men in Middenyard?”\evb\evg


\bvg\bva „Þú est Óttarr \hld\ borinn Innstęini, &
en Innstęinn vas \hld\ Alfi inum gamla, &
Alfr vas Ulfi, \hld\ Ulfr Sę́fara, &
en Sę́fari \hld\ Svan inum rauða.\eva

\bvb {[Hindle quoth:]} “Thou\footnoteB{Hindle, maybe in a trance-like state, speaks straight to Oughter.} art, Oughter, born to Instone, \\
and Instone was born to Elf the old, \\
Elf to Wolf, Wolf to Seafare, \\
and Seafare to Swan the red.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Móður átti faðir þinn \hld\ męnjum gǫfga, &
hygg at héti \hld\ Hlédís gyðja, &
Fróði vas faðir þęirar, \hld\ en \edtext{Fríund}{\Afootnote{emend. from meaningless \emph{†friaut†} \FlatMS}} móðir; &
ǫll þótti ę́tt sú \hld\ með yfir-mǫnnum.\eva

\bvb Thy father had thy mother, esteemed with neck-rings, \\
I think that she was called Leedise the \inx[C]{gidden}. \\
Frood was her father and Friend her mother; \\
all her lineage seemed to be among \inx[C]{overmen}.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Auði vas áðr \hld\ ǫflgastr manna, &
Halfdanr fyrri \hld\ hę́str Skjǫldunga, &
frę́g vǫ́ru folk-víg, \hld\ þau’s framir gęrðu, &
hvarfla þóttu verk \hld\ með himins skautum.\eva

\bvb Ed was once the mightiest of men, \\
Halfdane earlier the highest of Shieldings. \\
Renowned were the troop-conflicts \ken{wars} which the famous ones made; \\
his \name{= Halfdane’s} works seemed to circle along the corners of heaven.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Ęflðisk við Ęymund \hld\ ǿðstan manna &
en vá Sigtrygg \hld\ með svǫlum ęggjum, &
ęiga gekk Almvęig, \hld\ ǿðsta kvinna, &
ólu þau ok ǫ́ttu \hld\ átján sonu.\eva

\bvb He \name{= Halfdane} became the in-law of Iemund\footnoteB{lit. “[he] was strengthened by”.  Elmwey was Iemund’s daughter or sister.}, the noblest of men, \\
and he slew Syetrue with cool edges. \\
He went on to have Elmwey, the noblest of women; \\
they begot and had eighteen sons.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Þaðan eru Skjǫldungar, \hld\ þaðan eru Skilfingar, &
þaðan eru Ǫðlingar, \hld\ þaðan eru Ynglingar, &
þaðan es hǫld-borit, \hld\ þaðan es hęrs-borit, &
mest manna val \hld\ und Mið-garði; &
alt ’s þat ę́tt þín, \hld\ Óttarr hęimski.\eva

\bvb Thence come the Shieldings! Thence come the Shilvings! \\
Thence come the Athlings! Thence come the Inglings!\footnote{Note the contradiction with v. 12. Since the Inglings have already been mentioned (under the name Shilvings, for the difference between the two see Encyclopedia), it seems likely that Wolvings is the original reading.} \\
Thence is born of hero! Thence is born of chief \\
the mightiest choice of men in Middenyard! \\
All of this is thy lineage, O foolish Oughter!”\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Vas Hildigunnr \hld\ hęnnar móðir, &
Svǫ́fu barn \hld\ ok Sę́-konungs; &
alt ’s þat ę́tt þín, \hld\ Óttarr hęimski. &
varði at viti svá, \hld\ viltu ęnn lęngra?\eva

\bvb Hildguth was her mother, \\
the child of Sweve and Sea-king. \\
All of this is thy lineage, O foolish Oughter!— \\
It is meaningful that one might know thus; wilt thou [hear] yet further?\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Dagr átti Þóru \hld\ dręngja móður, &
ólusk í ę́tt þar \hld\ ǿðstir kappar, &
Fraðmarr ok Gyrðr \hld\ ok Frekar báðir, &
Ámr ok Jǫsurmarr, \hld\ Alfr hinn gamli. &
varðar at viti svá, \hld\ viltu ęnn lęngra?\eva

\bvb Day had Thure, the mother of valiant men; \\
in that lineage were begotten the noblest champions: \\
Fradmer and Yird, and both Frekes; \\
Ame and Essirmer; Elf the old.— \\
It is meaningful that one might know thus; wilt thou [hear] yet further?\evb\evg


\bvg\bva Kętill hét vinr þęira \hld\ Klypps arf-þęgi, &
vas hann móður-faðir \hld\ móður þinnar; &
þar vas Fróði \hld\ fyrr ęnn Kári, &
en Hildi vas \hld\ Hóalfr of getinn.\eva

\bvb Kettle was their friend, the heir of Clip; \\
he was the father of thy mother's mother. \\
There was Frood, yet earlier Keer, \\
but by Hild was Highelf begotten.\evb\evg
