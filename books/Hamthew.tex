\bva Vęl hǫfum vit vegit, \hld\ stǫndum á val Gotna &
ofan ęggmóðum \hld\ sem ęrnir á kvisti; &
góðs hǫfum tírar fengit \hld\ þótt skylim nú eða í gę́r dęyja, &
kvęld lifir maðr ekki \hld\ ęftir kvið norna.\eva

\bvb “Well have we two fought; we stand on the corpses of the Gots; above the edge-weary ones like eagles on a branch. We have earned great glory although we should die now or tomorrow—man lives not a single evening after the verdict of the norns!”\evb

\bvg
\bva Þar fell Sǫrli \hld\ at salar gafli, &
en Hamðir hné \hld\ at húsbaki.\eva

\bvb There Sarrel fell by the gables of the hall, by Hamthew sank down by the back of the house.\evb
