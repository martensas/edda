\bva Níðuðr hét konungr í Svíþjóð. \bva Hann átti tvá sonu ok eina dóttur. Hon hét Böðvildr. \bva Bræðr váru þrír, synir Finnakonungs. \bva Hét einn Slagfiðr, annarr Egill, þriði Völundr. \bva Þeir skriðu ok veiddu dýr. Þeir kómu í Úlfdali ok gerðu sér þar hús. \bva Þar er vatn, er heitir Úlfsjár. \bva Snemma of morgin fundu þeir á vatnsströndu konur þrjár, ok spunnu lín. \bva Þar váru hjá þeim álftarhamir þeira. Þat váru valkyrjur. \bva Þar váru tvær dætr Hlöðvés konungs, Hlaðguðr svanhvít ok Hervör alvitr, in þriðja var Ölrún Kjársdóttir af Vallandi. \bva Þeir höfðu þær heim til skála með sér. Fekk Egill Ölrúnar, en Slagfiðr Svanhvítrar, en Völundr Alvitrar. \bva Þau bjuggu sjau vetr. Þá flugu þær at vitja víga ok kómu eigi aftr. \bva Þá skreið Egill at leita Ölrúnar, en Slagfiðr leitaði Svanhvítrar, en Völundr sat í Úlfdölum. \bva Hann var hagastr maðr, svá at menn viti, í fornum sögum. \bva Níðuðr konungr lét hann höndum taka, svá sem hér er um kveðit: \\%E

\bvb Nithad was named a king in Sweden. \bvb He owned two sons and one daughter, she was called Beadhild. \bvb There were three brothers, the sons of a Finnish king. \bvb The first was called Beatfinn, the second Egil, the third Wayland. \bvb They travelled on skis and hunted wild animals. They came into Wolfdale and made for themselves houses there. \bvb There is a water there, called Wolfsea. \bvb Early in the morning they found on the lake-shore three women, and they were spinning linen. \bvb By them were their swan-\textbf{hames}; those were \textbf{Walkyrries}. \bvb Two of them were the daughters of King Latheway, Loadguth Swanwhite and Hereware Allwit; the third was Alerune Kear's daughter, from \textbf{Walland}. \bvb The [brothers] brought the [women] with them to their halls. Egil got Alerune, but Beatfinn Swanwhite, but Wayland Allwit. \bvb They lived there for seven winters, then they left to attend battles, and did not return. \bvb Then Egil left on skis to seek out Alerune, but Beatfinn sought out Swanwhite, but Wayland stayed in Wolfdale. \bvb He was the most skillful man, which men have known in ancient tales. \bvb King Nithad had him taken, about which this has been sung: \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Męyjar flugu sunnan \hld Myrkvið í gǫgnum
alvitr ungar, \hld ørlǫg drýgja; \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Maidens flew from the south through \textbf{Mirkwood}, young allwits†, to fulfill orlay†. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva þær á sævarstrǫnd \hld sęttusk at hvílask
drósir suðrǿnar, \hld dýrt lín spunnu. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb They on the sea-shore set down to rest, the southern ladies, expensive linen they span. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Ęin nam þęira \hld Ęgil at vęrja
fǫgr mær fira \hld faðmi ljósum.
Ǫnnur vas Svanhvít, \hld svanfjaðrar dró,
ęn hin þriðja \hld þęira systir
varði hvítan \hld hals Vǫlundar. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb One of them took to ward Egil, the wise maiden of men by the light bosom; the second was Swanwhite, her swan-feathers she pulled, but the third of the sisters warded the white neck of Wayland. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Sǫ́tu síðan \hld sjau vetr at þat,
ęn hinn átta \hld allan þrǫ́ðu,
ęn hinn níunda \hld nauðr of skilði,
męyjar fýstusk \hld á myrkvan við,
alvitr ungar \hld ørlǫg drýgja. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Then they remained for seven winters at that, and all the eighth, they yearned, and on the ninth need divorced them: the maidens longed for the dark woods, the young allwits, to fulfill orlay. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Kom þar af vęiði \hld veðręygr skyti
Vǫlundr líðandi \hld of langan veg,
Slagfiðr ok Ęgill, \hld sali fundu auða,
gingu út ok inn \hld ok umb sǫ́usk. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Came there from the hunt, the weather-eyed shooter, Wayland passing from a long journey. Slayfinn and Egil found the halls deserted, they walked out and in, and about them looked. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Austr skręið Ęgill \hld at Ǫlrúnu,
ęn suðr Slagfiðr \hld at Svanhvítu,
ęn ęinn Vǫlundr \hld sat í Ulfdǫlum. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb East travelled Egil for Alerune, but southwards Slayfinn for Swanwhite, but alone Wayland remained, in the Wolfdales. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Hann sló goll rautt \hld við gim fastan,
lukði hann alla \hld lindbaugum vel;
svá bęið hann \hld sinnar ljóssar
kvánar, ef hǫ́num \hld of koma gęrði. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb He struck the red gold by fastened gemstone, enclosed he all the armrings well; thus awaited he his bright wife, if to him she might come. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Þat spyrr Níðuðr, \hld Níara dróttinn,
at ęinn Vǫlundr \hld sat í Ulfdǫlum;
nóttum fóru sęggir, \hld nęglðar vǫ́ru brynjur,
skildir bliku þęira \hld við hinn skarða mána. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Nithad learns, Lord of the Nears, that alone Wayland remained in Wolfdales; at nights travelled warriors — nailed were their byrnies — their shields gleamed by the waning moon. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Stigu ór sǫðlum \hld at salar gafli,
gingu inn þaðan \hld ęndlangan sal,
sǫ́u þęir á bast \hld bauga dręgna,
sjau hundruð allra, \hld es sá sęggr átti. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb They stepped out of the saddles, towards the hall’s gables, they walked inside thence across the length of the hall. They saw on a bast-rope, armrings drawn, seven hundred in all, which that man owned. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Ok þęir af tóku \hld ok þęir á létu
fyr ęinn útan, \hld es af létu;
kom þar af vęiði \hld veðręygr skyti
Vǫlundr líðandi \hld of langan veg. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb And they took off, and they put back on, but for one, which away they put. — Came there from the hunt, the weather-eyed shooter, Wayland passing from a long journey. \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Gekk brúnni \hld beru hold stęikja,
ár brann hrísi \hld allþurru fura,
viðr hinn vindþurri, \hld fyr Vǫlundi. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb He went, the brown she-bear’s hull to roast; early burned the brushwood, the all-dry pine, the wind-dry wood, before Wayland.

\begin{verse}
\bva Sat á berfjalli, \hld bauga talði,
alfa ljóði \hld ęins saknaði.
hugði at hęfði \hld Hlǫðvés dóttir,
Alvitr unga, \hld væri aptr komin.
 
\bvb Sat he on the bare mountain, his rings counted — the prince of elves was missing one! He thought that the daughter of Ladwigh might have it, that the young Allwit might be come again.

\begin{verse}
\bva Sat hann svá lęngi, \hld at hann sofnaði,
ok hann vaknaði \hld viljalauss;
vissi sér á hǫndum \hld hǫfgar nauðir,
ęn á fótum \hld fjǫtur of spęntan. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb He sat so long, that asleep he fell, and he awoke, powerless; he knew on his hands tortuous restraints, and on his feet fetters tightened.

\begin{verse}
(Vǫlundr kvað) \\
\bva Hvęrir ’ró jǫfrar \hld þęir’s á lǫgðu
bęstisíma \hld ok bundu mik? \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Wayland quoth: \\
“Who are those princes, that laid on thick bast-ropes, and bound me?”

\begin{verse}
\bva (Kallaði Níðuðr, \hld Níara dróttinn):
“Hvar gazt Vǫlundr, \hld vísi alfa,
óra aura, \hld í Ulfdǫlum?” \\%E

\end{verse}

\bvb Nithad called, Lord of the Nears: “Where got thou Wayland, leader of Elves, our ounces\footnotemark[1], in Wolfdales?”
\footnotetext[1]{Of gold.}

\begin{verse}
(Vǫlundr kvað) \\
\bva Goll vas þar ęigi \hld á Grana lęiðu,
fjarri hugða’k várt land \hld fjǫllum Rínar.
Man’k at męiri \hld mæti ǫ́ttum,
es vér hęil hjú \hld hęima vǫ́rum. \\%E
Hlaðguðr ok Hervǫr \hld borin vas Hlǫðvé,
kunn vas Ǫlrún \hld Kíars dóttir.  \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Wayland quoth: \\
\bvb “Gold was there not on Grane’s path, far I judge our land from the mountains of the Rhine. I remembered that we owned a more precious thing, when we a healthy household were at home. Ladguth and Harware were born to Ladwigh, known was Alerune, Keer’s daughter.”

\begin{verse}
\bva Úti stóð kunnig \hld kvǫ́n Níðaðar,
hón inn of gekk \hld ęndlangan sal,
stóð á golfi, \hld stilti rǫddu:
es-a sá nú hýrr, \hld es ór holti fęrr. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Outside stood the cunning wife of Nithad; she walked inside across the length of the hall; she stood on the floor, steered her voice: “He is not happy, who now comes out of the wood.\footnotemark[1]”
\footnotetext[1]{The abducted Wayland.}

\begin{verse}
\bva Tęnn hǫ́num tęygjask \hld es hǫ́num’s tét sverð
ok hann Bǫðvildar \hld baug of þękkir.
Ǫ́mun eru augu \hld ormi hinum frána,
tęnn hǫ́num tęygjask, \hld es tét es sverð
ok hann Bǫðvildar \hld baug of þękkir,
sníðið hann sina \hld sinna magni,
sętið hann síðan \hld í Sævarstǫð. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb The teeth on him appear, as if he carries swords, and he covets the armring of Beadhild; the eyes remind me of a bright snake’s. — Cut ye off him the power of his sinews, and place him then on Seastead!

\begin{verse}
\bva Svá var gǫrt, at skornar váru sinar í knésfótum ok settr í holm einn, er þar var fyrir landi, er hét Sævarstaðr. Þar smíðaði hann konungi allskyns gǫrsimar; engi maðr þorði at fara til hans, nema konungr einn. Vǫlundr kvað: \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Thus was done, that the sinews in his houghs were cut, and he was placed on an alone islet, which there lay by the land, and was called Seastead. There he smithed for the king all manner of jewels; no man dared to travel to him, but the king alone. Wayland quoth: \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Sé’k Níðaði \hld sverð á linda,
þat’s ek hvęsta \hld sęm hagast kunna’k
ok ek hęrða’k \hld sęm hǿgst þótti;
sá ’s mér fránn mækir \hld æ fjarri borinn.
sé’kk-a þann Vǫlundi \hld til smiðju borinn. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb I see a sword on Nithad’s belt, the one I sharped as I most handily knew, and I hardened as to me most easily seemed; now that gleaming sword is ever carried far from me, I see it not carried to Wayland’s smithy.

\begin{verse}
\bva Nú berr Bǫðvildr \hld brúðar minnar,
bíð’k-a þess bót, \hld bauga rauða. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Now Beadhild bears the red armrings—I get no recompense for that—of my bride.

\begin{verse}
\bva Sat hann né svaf ávalt \hld ok sló hamri;
vél gęrði hęldr \hld hvatt Níðaðí;
drifu ungir tvęir \hld á dýr séa
synir Níðaðar \hld í Sævarstǫð. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb He sat nor slept always, and struck the hammer, rather he keenly planned treachery for Nithad; two young ones were hurrying to look at the precious things, the sons of Nithad, towards Seastead.

\begin{verse}
\bva Kvǫ́mu til kistu, \hld krǫfðu lukla,
opin vas illúð, \hld es í sǫ́u,
fjǫlð vas þar męina, \hld es mǫgum sýndisk
at væri goll rautt \hld ok gǫrsimar. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb They came to the chest, demanded the keys, open was the evil, when inside they looked; in there was a multitude of harm, which to the lads seemed like it were red gold and jewels.

\begin{verse}
\bva Komið ęinir tvęir, \hld komið annars dags;
ykkr læt’k þat goll \hld of gefit verða;
sęgið-a męyjum \hld né salþjóðum,
manni ęngum, \hld at mik fyndið. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Come alone ye two, come another day! To you I will have that gold be given; tell not maidens, nor the people of the hall, not any man, that ye met me.

\begin{verse}
\bva Snimma kallaði \hld sęggr á annan,
bróðir á bróður: \hld gǫngum baug séa.
Kómu til kistu, \hld krǫfðu lukla,
opin vas illúð \hld es í litu. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Early called one man to another, brother to brother: “Let us go see the rings!”. They came to the chest, demanded the keys, open was the evil, when inside they looked.

\begin{verse}
\bva Snęið af hǫfuð \hld húna þęira
ok und fęn fjǫturs \hld fǿtr of lagði,
ęn þær skálar, \hld es und skǫrum vǫ́ru,
svęip útan silfri, \hld sęldi Níðaði. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb He sliced off the heads of those bear-cubs\footnotemark[1], and under the fetter’s fen their feet did lay, — but the bowls, which under their locks were\footnotemark[2], he coated with silver, and gave to Nithad.
\footnotetext[1]{The sons of Nithad.}
\footnotetext[2]{Their skulls.}

\begin{verse}
\bva Ęn ór augum \hld jarknastęina
sęndi kunnigri \hld kvǫ́n Níðaðar;
ęn ór tǫnnum \hld tvęggja þęira
sló brjóstkringlur, \hld sęndi Bǫðvildi. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb But out of the eyes earkenstones, he sent to the cunning wife of Nithad, but out of the teeth of the two, he struck breast-brooches, [which he] sent to Beadhild.

\begin{verse}
\bva Þá nam Bǫðvildr \hld baugi at hrósa
[...] \hld es brotit hafði,
“þori’k-a’k sęgja, \hld nema þér ęinum.”  \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Then Beadhild began to praise the ring, [...] which she had broken, “I dare not tell anyone, but thee alone.”\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{Clearly the verse is incomplete. Beadhild breaks a ring she has been given, but does not dare tell anybody but Wayland.}

\begin{verse}
\bva “Ek bǿti svá \hld brest á golli,
at fęðr þínum \hld fęgri þykkir,
ok mǿðr þinni \hld miklu bętri,
ok sjalfri þér \hld at sama hófi.”  \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb “I will mend so the crack on the gold, that to thy father it will seem fairer, and to thy mother much better, and to thyself just the same.”

\begin{verse}
\bva Bar hann hána bjóri, \hld þvíat hann bętr kunni,
svát hón í sessi \hld of sofnaði.
»Nú hęfk hęfnt \hld harma minna
allra nema ęinna \hld íviðgjǫrnum.” \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb He overcame her with beer — for he was more cunning — so that she in the seat asleep did fall. “Now I have avenged my injustices, — all but one, — on the insidious ones\footnotemark[1].”
\footnotetext[1]{King Nithad and his wife.}

\begin{verse}
\bva “Vęl ek, kvað Vǫlundr, \hld verða’k á fitjum,
þęim’s mik Níðaðar \hld nǫ́mu rekkar.«”
Hlæjandi Vǫlundr \hld hófsk at lopti,
grátandi Bǫðvildr \hld gekk ór ęyju.
tregði fǫr friðils \hld ok fǫður vreiði. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb “Well I”, quoth Wayland, “fall on my paddles, those which Nithad’s men bereaved me of!”\footnotemark[1] Laughing Wayland threw himself in the air; weeping Beadhild went from the island, grieved the flight of the lover, and the fury of the father.
\footnotetext[1]{\emph{C-V}: \emph{fit} ‘the webbed foot of water-birds’, the reader may picture for himself. Wayland has crafted wings in stead of his feet, of which use Nithad’s men deprived him.}

\begin{verse}
\bva Úti stóð kunnig \hld kvǫ́n Níðaðar,
ok hón inn of gekk \hld ęndlangan sal,
— ęn hann á salgarð \hld sęttisk at hvílask —,
»Vakir þú Níðuðr, \hld Níara dróttinn?«  \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Outside stood the cunning wife of Nithad; she walked inside across the length of the hall, — but he, on the courtyard, set down to rest —, “Art thou awake, Nithad, Lord of the Nears?”

\begin{verse}
\bva “Vaki’k ávalt \hld viljalauss,
sofna’k minst, \hld síz sonu dauða,
kęll mik í hǫfuð, \hld kǫld erumk rǫ́ð þín,
vilnumk þess nú, \hld at við Vǫlund dǿma’k.” \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb “I wake always, powerless; I sleep the least, since the death of my sons. My head freezes, cold are thy counsels; I wish now but that, to speak with Wayland.”

\begin{verse}
\bva “Sęg mér þat Vǫlundr, \hld vísi alfa,
af hęilum hvat varð \hld húnum mínum?” \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb “Say that to me, Wayland, leader of Elves, what became of my healthy bear-cubs?”

\begin{verse}
\bva Ęiða skalt mér áðr \hld alla vinna,
at skips borði \hld ok at skjaldar rǫnd,
at mars bǿgi \hld ok at mækis ęgg
at þú kvęlj-at \hld kvǫ́n Vǫlundar,
né brúði minni \hld at bana verðir,
þótt kvǫ́n ęigim, \hld þá’s ér kunnið,
eða jóð ęigim \hld innan hallar. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb “Before that shalt thou swear me all oaths, — by the deck of the ship and the rim of the shield, by the bough of the steed and the edge of the sword, — that thou wilt not torment the wife of Wayland, nor of my bride become the bane, though we might own a wife, which ye might know, or own a baby inside the hall.\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{Wayland makes Nithad swear an oath that he will not harm Beadhild (“a wife, which ye might know”), nor their (yet unborn) child.}

\begin{verse}
\bva Gakk til smiðju, \hld es gęrðir þú,
þar fiðr þú bęlgi \hld blóði stokna,
snęið’k af hǫfuð \hld húna þinna
ok und fęn fjǫturs \hld fǿtr of lagða’k. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Go to the smithy, which thou made; there thou wilt find bellows, sprinkled with blood. I sliced off the heads of those bear-cubs, and under the fetter’s fen their feet did I lay.

\begin{verse}
\bva Ęn þær skálar, \hld es und skǫrum vǫ́ru,
svęip’k útan silfri, \hld sęlda’k Níðaði,
ęn ór augum \hld jarknastęina,
sęnda'k kunnigri \hld kvǫ́n Níðaðar. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb But the bowls, which under their locks were, I coated with silver, and gave to Nithad. But out of the eyes earkenstones, I sent to the cunning wife of Nithad.

\begin{verse}
\bva Ęn ór tǫnnum \hld tvęggja þęira
sló’k brjóstkringlur, \hld sęnda’k Bǫðvildi;
nú gęngr Bǫðvildr \hld barni aukin,
ęingadóttir \hld ykkur bęggja.” \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb But out of the teeth of the two, I struck breast-brooches, [which] I sent to Beadhild; now walks Beadhild pregnant with child, the only daughter of you both.”

\begin{verse}
\bva “Mæltir-a þú þat mál, \hld es mik męir tregi,
né þik vilja’k Vǫlundr \hld verr of níta;
es-at svá maðr hǫ́r, \hld at þik af hęsti taki,
né svá ǫflugr, \hld at þik neðan skjóti.
þar’s þú skollir \hld við ský uppi.” \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb “Thou could not have spoken that speech, which might grieve me more, nor could I wish worse, Wayland, to deny thee. There is no man so high, that he might from a horse take thee, nor so mighty, that he might shoot thee down, there where thou jeers, high against the clouds.”

\begin{verse}
\bva Hlæjandi Vǫlundr \hld hófsk at lopti,
ęn ókátr Níðuðr \hld þá ęptir sat. \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb Laughing Wayland threw himself in the air, but gloomy Nithad then afterwards remained.

\begin{verse}
\bva “Upp rís Þakkráðr, \hld þræll minn bazti,
bið Bǫðvildi, \hld męy hina bráhvítu,
gangi fagrvarið \hld við fǫður rǿða.” \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb “Rise up Thankred, my best thrall; ask Beadhild, — the brow-white maiden, — to go fair-clothed, with her father to counsel.”

\begin{verse}
\bva “Es þat satt Bǫðvildr, \hld es sǫgðu mér,
sǫ́tuð it Vǫlundr \hld saman í holmi?” \\%E
\end{verse}

\bvb “Is it true, Beadhild, what they said to me; sat thou and Wayland, together on the island?” \\

\begin{verse}
\bva Satt ’s þat Níðuðr \hld es sagði þér.
Sǫ́tum vit Vǫlundr \hld saman í holmi
ęina ǫgurstund, \hld æva skyldi;
ek vætr hǫ́num \hld vinna kunna’k,
ek vætr hǫ́num \hld vinna mátta’k.
\end{verse}

\bvb “It is true, Nithad, what \emph{he} said\footnotemark[1] to thee; I and Wayland sat together on the island, for a single grave moment — it should never have been. I knew nought struggle against him, I could nought struggle against him.\footnotemark[2]”
\footnotetext[1]{Beadhild, knowing that the only one who is aware of what happened is Wayland, changes the person from her father’s general plural, to the specific singular.}
\footnotetext[2]{She was both mentally (\emph{C-V}: \emph{kunna} ‘know, understand’) and physically (\emph{C-V}: \emph{mega} ‘to have strength to do, avail’) incapable of struggling against him. As Finnur comments, an unsurpassed ending.}
