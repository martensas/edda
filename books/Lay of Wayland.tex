\bva Níðuðr hét konungr í Svíþjóð.
\bva Hann átti tvá sonu ok eina dóttur. Hon hét Böðvildr.
\bva Bræðr váru þrír, synir Finnakonungs.
\bva Hét einn Slagfiðr, annarr Egill, þriði Völundr.
\bva Þeir skriðu ok veiddu dýr. Þeir kómu í Úlfdali ok gerðu sér þar hús.
\bva Þar er vatn, er heitir Úlfsjár.
\bva Snemma of morgin fundu þeir á vatnsströndu konur þrjár, ok spunnu lín.
\bva Þar váru hjá þeim álftarhamir þeira. Þat váru valkyrjur.
\bva Þar váru tvær dætr Hlöðvés konungs, Hlaðguðr svanhvít ok Hervör alvitr, in þriðja var Ölrún Kjársdóttir af Vallandi.
\bva Þeir höfðu þær heim til skála með sér. Fekk Egill Ölrúnar, en Slagfiðr Svanhvítrar, en Völundr Alvitrar.
\bva Þau bjuggu sjau vetr. Þá flugu þær at vitja víga ok kómu eigi aftr.
\bva Þá skreið Egill at leita Ölrúnar, en Slagfiðr leitaði Svanhvítrar, en Völundr sat í Úlfdölum.
\bva Hann var hagastr maðr, svá at menn viti, í fornum sögum.
\bva Níðuðr konungr lét hann höndum taka, svá sem hér er um kveðit:\bva

\bvb Nithad was named a king in Sweden.
\bvb He owned two sons and one daughter, she was called Beadhild.
\bvb There were three brothers, the sons of a Finnish king.
\bvb The first was called Slayfinn, the second Agle, the third Wayland.
\bvb They travelled on skis and hunted wild animals. They came into Wolfdale and made for themselves houses there.
\bvb There is a water there, called Wolfsea.
\bvb Early in the morning they found on the lake-shore three women, and they were spinning linen.
\bvb By them were their swan-\inx{hames}; those were Walkirries.
\bvb Two of them were the daughters of king Lathwy: Lathguth Swanwhite and Harware Allwit, the third was Alerune, daughter of Kear of \inx{Walland}\Bfootnote{The Roman emperor. See Index for more.}.
\bvb They brought them with them to their halls. Agle got Alerune, but Beatfinn Swanwhite, but Wayland Allwit.
\bvb They lived there for seven winters, then they left to attend battles, and did not return.
\bvb Then Agle left on skis to seek out Alerune, but Beatfinn sought out Swanwhite, but Wayland stayed in Wolfdale.
\bvb He was the most skillful man, which men have known in ancient tales.
\bvb King Nithad had him taken, about which this has been sung:
\evg


\bvg
\bva Męyjar flugu sunnan \hld\ Myrkvið í gǫgnum &
alvitr ungar, \hld\ ørlǫg drýgja; &
þær á sævarstrǫnd \hld\\ sęttusk at hvílask &
drósir suðrǿnar, \hld\ dýrt lín spunnu.\bva
\bvb Maidens flew from the south through Mirkwood, young allwits\footnoteB{Maybe look at what this means. TODO.}, to fulfill \inx{orlay}[C]. They on the lake-shore set down to rest; the southern ladies span expensive linen.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ęin nam þęira \hld\ Ęgil at vęrja &
fǫgr mær fira \hld\ faðmi ljósum. &
Ǫnnur vas Svanhvít, \hld\ svanfjaðrar dró, &
\edtext{—}{\Bfootnote{Without doubt a line has gone missing here, mentioning the name of Slayfinn.}}
ęn hin þriðja \hld\ þęira systir &
varði hvítan \hld\ hals Vǫlundar.\bva

\bvb One of them took to ward Agle, the wise maiden of men by the light bosom; the second was Swanwhite, her swan-feathers she pulled, but the third of the sisters warded the white neck of Wayland.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Sǫ́tu síðan \hld\ sjau vetr at þat, &
ęn hinn átta \hld\ allan þrǫ́ðu, &
ęn hinn níunda \hld\ nauðr of skilði, &
męyjar fýstusk \hld\ á myrkvan við, &
alvitr ungar \hld\ ørlǫg drýgja.\bva

\bvb Then they remained for seven winters after that, and all the eighth they yearned, and on the ninth did need separate them: the maidens longed for the Mirky wood: the young allwits to fulfill orlay.\footnoteB{Mirkwood being the war-ravaged lands of the Gots and Huns; as walkirries their \emph{orlay} is to judge over battles.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Kom þar af vęiði \hld\ veðręygr skyti &
Vǫlundr líðandi \hld\ of langan veg, &
Slagfiðr ok Ęgill, \hld\ sali fundu auða, &
gingu út ok inn \hld\ ok umb sǫ́usk.\bva

\bvb Came there from the hunt the weather-eyed shooter: Wayland passing from a long journey. Slayfinn and Agle found the halls deserted, they walked out and in, and looked about them.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Austr skręið Ęgill \hld\ at Ǫlrúnu, &
ęn suðr Slagfiðr \hld\ at Svanhvítu, &
ęn ęinn Vǫlundr \hld\ sat í Ulfdǫlum.\bva

\bvb East skied Agle for Alerune, but south Slayfinn for Swanwhite, but alone Wayland remained in the Wolfdales.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Hann sló goll rautt \hld\ við gim fastan, &
lukði hann alla \hld\ linnbaugum vel; &
svá bęið hann \hld\ sinnar ljóssar &
kvánar, ef hǫ́num \hld\ of koma gęrði.\bva

\bvb He struck the red gold by fastened gemstone, enclosed he all the serpent-\inx{bighs}\Bfootnote{\emph{bighs} (ie. armlets) shaped like serpents, perhaps even literally; compare the Viking age armlet found in a hoard in Undrom, Ångermanland, northern Sweden, Museum ID 108822_HST. TODO: Maybe include photo?} well; thus awaited he his bright wife, if to him she might come.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þat spyrr Níðuðr, \hld\ Níara dróttinn, &
at ęinn Vǫlundr \hld\ sat í Ulfdǫlum; &
nóttum fóru sęggir, \hld\ nęglðar vǫ́ru brynjur, &
skildir bliku þęira \hld\ við hinn skarða mána.\bva

\bvb Nithad learns, Lord of the Nears, that alone Wayland remained in Wolfdales; in nights travelled warriors—nailed were their byrnies—their shields gleamed by the waning moon.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Stigu ór sǫðlum \hld\ at salar gafli, &
gingu inn þaðan \hld\ ęndlangan sal, &
sǫ́u þęir á bast \hld\ bauga dręgna, &
sjau hundruð allra, \hld\ es sá sęggr átti.\bva

\bvb They stepped out of the saddles, towards the hall’s gables, they walked inside thence across the length of the hall. They saw on a bast-rope, armrings drawn, seven hundred in all, which that man owned.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ok þęir af tóku \hld\ ok þęir á létu &
fyr ęinn útan, \hld\ es af létu; &
kom þar af vęiði \hld\ veðręygr skyti &
Vǫlundr líðandi \hld\ of langan veg.\bva

\bvb And they took off, and they put back on, but for one, which away they put. — Came there from the hunt, the weather-eyed shooter, Wayland passing from a long journey.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Gekk brúnni \hld\ beru hold stęikja, &
ár brann hrísi \hld\ allþurru fura, &
viðr hinn vindþurri, \hld\ fyr Vǫlundi.\bva

\bvb He went, the brown she-bear’s hull to roast; early burned the brushwood, the all-dry pine, the wind-dry wood, before Wayland.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Sat á berfjalli, \hld\ bauga talði, &
alfa ljóði \hld\ ęins saknaði. &
hugði at hęfði \hld\ Hlǫðvés dóttir, &
Alvitr unga, \hld\ væri aptr komin.\eva

\bvb Sat he on the bare mountain, his rings counted — the prince of elves was missing one! He thought that the daughter of Ladwigh might have it, that the young Allwit might be come again.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Sat hann svá lęngi, \hld\ at hann sofnaði, &
ok hann vaknaði \hld\ viljalauss; &
vissi sér á hǫndum \hld\ hǫfgar nauðir, &
ęn á fótum \hld\ fjǫtur of spęntan.\bva

\bvb He sat so long, that asleep he fell, and he awoke, powerless; he knew on his hands tortuous restraints, and on his feet fetters tightened.\evb
\evg


\bvg
(Vǫlundr kvað)
\bva Hvęrir ’ró jǫfrar \hld\ þęir’s á lǫgðu &
bęstisíma \hld\ ok bundu mik?\bva

\bvb Wayland quoth: \\
“Who are those princes, that laid on thick bast-ropes, and bound me?”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva (Kallaði Níðuðr, \hld\ Níara dróttinn): &
»Hvar gazt Vǫlundr, \hld\ vísi alfa, &
óra aura, \hld\ í Ulfdǫlum?»\bva

\bvb Nithad called, Lord of the Nears: “Where gotst thou Wayland, leader of Elves, \emph{our} ounces\footnoteB{Of gold.} in the Wolfdales?”\evb
\evg


\bvg
(Vǫlundr kvað)
\bva »Goll vas þar ęigi \hld\ á Grana lęiðu, &
fjarri hugða’k várt land \hld\ fjǫllum Rínar. &
Man’k at męiri \hld\ mæti ǫ́ttum, &
es vér hęil hjú \hld\ hęima vǫ́rum. &
Hlaðguðr ok Hervǫr \hld\ borin vas Hlǫðvé, &
kunn vas Ǫlrún \hld\ Kíars dóttir.»\bva

Wayland quoth: \\
\bvb “Gold was there not on Grane’s path, far I judge our land from the mountains of the Rhine. I remembered that we owned a more precious thing, when we a healthy household were at home. Ladguth and Harware were born to Ladwigh, known was Alerune, Keer’s daughter.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Úti stóð kunnig \hld\ kvǫ́n Níðaðar, &
hón inn of gekk \hld\ ęndlangan sal, &
stóð á golfi, \hld\ stilti rǫddu: &
»es-a sá nú hýrr, \hld\ es ór holti fęrr.\bva

\bvb Outside stood the cunning wife of Nithad; she walked inside across the length of the hall; she stood on the floor, steered her voice: That one\footnoteB{The abducted Wayland.} is now not cheery, who comes out of the wood.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Tęnn hǫ́num tęygjask \hld\ es hǫ́num’s tét sverð &
ok hann Bǫðvildar \hld\ baug of þękkir. &
Ǫ́mun eru augu \hld\ ormi hinum frána, &
tęnn hǫ́num tęygjask, \hld\ es tét es sverð &
ok hann Bǫðvildar \hld\ baug of þękkir, &
sníðið hann sina \hld\ sinna magni, &
sętið hann síðan \hld\ í Sævarstǫð.»\bva

\bvb The teeth on him are bared, when he is shown the sword, and he recognizes Beadhild’s bigh; reminiscent are the eyes to the gleaming snake’s.—Cut ye from him the might of his sinews, and place him then on Seastead!”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva[P] Svá var gǫrt, at skornar váru sinar í knésfótum ok settr í holm einn, er þar var fyrir landi, er hét Sævarstaðr. Þar smíðaði hann konungi allskyns gǫrsimar; engi maðr þorði at fara til hans, nema konungr einn. Vǫlundr kvað:\bva

\bvb[P] Thus was done, that the sinews in his houghs were cut, and he was placed on an alone islet, which there lay by the land, and was called Seastead. There he smithed for the king all manner of jewels; no man dared to travel to him, but the king alone. Wayland quoth:
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Sé’k Níðaði \hld\ sverð á linda, &
þat’s ek hvęsta \hld\ sęm hagast kunna’k &
ok ek hęrða’k \hld\ sęm hǿgst þótti; &
sá ’s mér fránn mækir \hld\ æ fjarri borinn. &
sé’kk-a þann Vǫlundi \hld\ til smiðju borinn.\bva

\bvb I see a sword on Nithad’s belt, the one I sharped as I most handily knew, and I hardened as to me most easily seemed; now that gleaming sword is ever carried far from me, I see it not carried to Wayland’s smithy.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Nú berr Bǫðvildr \hld\ brúðar minnar, &
bíð’k-a þess bót, \hld\ bauga rauða.»\bva

\bvb Now Beadhild bears my bride’s—I get no recompense for that—red bighs.
\evg


\bvg
\bva Sat hann né svaf ávalt \hld\ ok sló hamri; &
vél gęrði hęldr \hld\ hvatt Níðaðí; &
drifu ungir tvęir \hld\ á dýr séa &
synir Níðaðar \hld\ í Sævarstǫð.\bva

\bvb He sat nor slept always, and struck the hammer, rather he keenly planned treachery for Nithad; two young ones hurried to look at the precious things, the sons of Nithad to Seastead.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Kvǫ́mu til kistu, \hld\ krǫfðu lukla, &
opin vas illúð, \hld\ es í sǫ́u, &
fjǫlð vas þar męina, \hld\ es mǫgum sýndisk &
at væri goll rautt \hld\ ok gǫrsimar.\bva

\bvb They came to the chest, demanded the keys; open was the evil, when inside they looked; in there was a multitude of harm, which to the lads seemed like it were red gold and jewels.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Komið ęinir tvęir, \hld\ komið annars dags; &
ykkr læt’k þat goll \hld\ of gefit verða; &
sęgið-a męyjum \hld\ né salþjóðum, &
manni ęngum, \hld\ at mik fyndið.\bva

\bvb Come alone ye two, come another day! To you I will have that gold be given; tell not maidens, nor the people of the hall, not any man, that ye met me.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Snimma kallaði \hld\ sęggr á annan, &
bróðir á bróður: \hld\ »gǫngum baug séa!»
Kómu til kistu, \hld\ krǫfðu lukla, &
opin vas illúð \hld\ es í litu.\bva

\bvb Early called one man to another, brother to brother: “Let us go see the bighs!”. They came to the chest, demanded the keys; open was the evil, when inside they looked.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Snęið af hǫfuð \hld\ húna þęira &
ok und fęn fjǫturs \hld\ fǿtr of lagði, &
ęn þær skálar, \hld\ es und skǫrum vǫ́ru, &
svęip útan silfri, \hld\ sęldi Níðaði.\bva

\bvb He sliced off the heads of those bear-cubs\footnoteB{The sons of Nithad.}, and under the fetter’s fen their feet did lay; but the bowls, which under their locks were\footnoteB{Their skulls.}, he coated with silver and gave to Nithad.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ęn ór augum \hld\ jarknastęina &
sęndi kunnigri \hld\ kvǫ́n Níðaðar; &
ęn ór tǫnnum \hld\ tvęggja þęira &
sló brjóstkringlur, \hld\ sęndi Bǫðvildi.\bva

\bvb But out of the eyes, earkenstones he sent to the cunning wife of Nithad; but out of the teeth of those two, he struck breast-brooches and sent to Beadhild.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þá nam Bǫðvildr \hld\ baugi at hrósa &
[...] \hld\ es brotit hafði, &
»þori’k-a’k sęgja, \hld\ nema þér ęinum.»\bva

\bvb Then Beadhild began to praise the ring, [...] which she had broken, “I dare not tell anyone, but thee alone.”\footnoteB{Clearly the verse is incomplete, but the story can be gleaned: Beadhild breaks a ring she has been given, but dares not tell anybody but Wayland.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Ek bǿti svá \hld\ brest á golli, &
at fęðr þínum \hld\ fęgri þykkir, &
ok mǿðr þinni \hld\ miklu bętri, &
ok sjalfri þér \hld\ at sama hófi.»\bva

\bvb “I mend such the crack on the gold, that to thy father it fairer seems, and to thy mother far better, and to thyself of the same quality.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Bar hann hána bjóri, \hld\ þvíat hann bętr kunni, &
svát hón í sessi \hld\ of sofnaði. &
»Nú hęfk hęfnt \hld\ harma minna &
allra nema ęinna \hld\ íviðgjǫrnum.»\bva

\bvb He overcame her with beer—for he was more cunning—so that she in the seat asleep did fall. “Now have I avenged my harms—all but one—on the insidious ones\footnoteB{King Nithad and his wife.}.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Vęl ek, kvað Vǫlundr, \hld\ verða’k á fitjum, &
þęim’s mik Níðaðar \hld\ nǫ́mu rekkar.» &
Hlæjandi Vǫlundr \hld\ hófsk at lopti, &
grátandi Bǫðvildr \hld\ gekk ór ęyju. &
tregði fǫr friðils \hld\ ok fǫður vreiði.\bva

\bvb “Well I”, quoth Wayland, “fall on my paddles\footnoteB{\emph{C-V}: \emph{fit} ‘the webbed foot of water-birds’, the reader may picture for himself. Wayland has crafted wings in stead of his feet, of which use Nithad’s men deprived him.}, those which Nithad’s men bereaved me of!” Laughing Wayland threw himself in the air; weeping Beadhild went from the island; she grieved the lover’s flight, and the father’s fury.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Úti stóð kunnig \hld\ kvǫ́n Níðaðar, &
ok hón inn of gekk \hld\ ęndlangan sal, &
— ęn hann á salgarð \hld\ sęttisk at hvílask —, &
»Vakir þú Níðuðr, \hld\ Níara dróttinn?»\bva

\bvb Outside stood the cunning wife of Nithad, she walked inside across the length of the hall—but he, on the courtyard, set down to rest. “Art thou awake, Nithad, lord of the Nears?”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Vaki’k ávalt \hld\ viljalauss, &
sofna’k minst, \hld\ síz sonu dauða, &
kęll mik í hǫfuð, \hld\ kǫld erumk rǫ́ð þín, &
vilnumk þess nú, \hld\ at við Vǫlund dǿma’k.»\bva

\bvb “I am always awake, powerless; I sleep the least, since the death of my sons. My head freezes, cold are thy counsels; I wish now but that: to speak with Wayland.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Sęg mér þat Vǫlundr, \hld\ vísi alfa, &
af hęilum hvat varð \hld\ húnum mínum?»\bva

\bvb “Say it to me, Wayland, leader of Elves: what became of my healthy bear-cubs?”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Ęiða skalt mér áðr \hld\ alla vinna, &
at skips borði \hld\ ok at skjaldar rǫnd, &
at mars bǿgi \hld\ ok at mækis ęgg &

þótt kvǫ́n ęigim, \hld\ þá’s ér kunnið, &
eða jóð ęigim \hld\ innan hallar.\bva

\bvb “Before that shalt thou swear me all oaths:—by the deck of the ship and the rim of the shield, by the bough of the steed and the edge of the sword—that thou wilt not torment the wife of Wayland, nor of my bride become the bane, though we a wife might own, which ye know, or a babe might own inside the hall.\footnoteB{Wayland has Nithad swear an oath that he will not harm Beadhild, nor their (yet unborn) child.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Gakk til smiðju, \hld\ es gęrðir þú, &
þar fiðr þú bęlgi \hld\ blóði stokna, &
snęið’k af hǫfuð \hld\ húna þinna &
ok und fęn fjǫturs \hld\ fǿtr of lagða’k.\bva

\bvb Go to the smithy, which thou made; there thou wilt find bellows, with blood sprinkled. I sliced off the heads of thy bear-cubs, and under the fetter’s fen their feet did I lay.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ęn þær skálar, \hld\ es und skǫrum vǫ́ru, &

sęnda'k kunnigri \hld\ kvǫ́n Níðaðar.\bva

\bvb But the bowls, which under their locks were, I coated with silver, and gave to Nithad. But out of the eyes earkenstones, I sent to the cunning wife of Nithad.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ęn ór tǫnnum \hld\ tvęggja þęira &

ęingadóttir \hld\ ykkur bęggja.»\bva

\bvb But out of the teeth of the two, I struck breast-brooches, [which] I sent to Beadhild. Now walks Beadhild, swollen with child; the only daughter of you both.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Mæltir-a þú þat mál, \hld\ es mik męir tregi, &

þar’s þú skollir \hld\ við ský uppi.»\bva

\bvb “Thou spokest not that speech, which might grieve me more, nor could I worse wish, Wayland, to deny thee. There is no man so high, that he from horse take thee, nor so mighty, that he shoot thee down, there where thou jeerest, high against the sky!”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Hlæjandi Vǫlundr \hld\ hófsk at lopti, &
ęn ókátr Níðuðr \hld\ þá ęptir sat.\bva

\bvb Laughing Wayland threw himself in the air, but gloomy Nithad afterwards remained.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Upp rís Þakkráðr, \hld\ þræll minn bazti, &
bið Bǫðvildi, \hld\ męy hina bráhvítu, &

\bvb “Rise up Thankred, my best thrall; ask Beadhild, — the brow-white maiden, — to go fair-clothed, with her father to counsel.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Es þat satt Bǫðvildr, \hld\ es sǫgðu mér, &
sǫ́tuð it Vǫlundr \hld\ saman í holmi?»\bva

\bvb “Is it true, Beadhild, what they said to me: stayed thou and Wayland together on the island?”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva »Satt ’s þat Níðuðr \hld\ es sagði þér: &

ęina ǫgurstund, \hld\ æva skyldi; &
ek vætr hǫ́num \hld\ vinna kunna’k, &
ek vætr hǫ́num \hld\ vinna mátta’k.»\eva

\bvb “It is true, Nithad, what \emph{he} said\footnoteB{Beadhild, knowing that the only one who is aware of what happened is Wayland, makes the subtle change in the conjugation, from her father’s general plural (“what \emph{they} said”), to the specific singular (“what \emph{he} said”).} to thee: I and Wayland stayed together on the island, for one grave moment—it should never have been. I \emph{knew} nought struggle against him, I \emph{could} nought struggle against him.\footnoteB{She was both mentally (\CV: \emph{kunna} ‘know, understand’) and physically (\CV: \emph{mega} ‘to have strength to do, avail’) incapable of struggling against him. As Finnur comments, a potent final verse.”\evb
