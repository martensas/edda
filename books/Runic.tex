\part{Misceallaneous Runic Poetry}

Not all poetry preserved in Runic inscriptions is included here; see below under Galders.  The stanza from the RÃ¶k runestone is included under Other Heroic Poetry, and the Runic version of the \emph{Dream of the Rood} is found there.

Metrically the poetry is generally in \Fornyrdislag.  A few fragments from Jutland are in \Ljodahattr\ and two from Sweden are in \Drottkvett.
