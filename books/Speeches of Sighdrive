Then the head of Mime spoke, eruditely the first word, and said true staves:

On a shield, he said, [runes] were carved, [on] the one that stands before the shining god, [also] on the ear of Yorewaker, on the hoof of Allswinn, on that wheel which turns beneath the chariot of Rungen, on the teeth of Slopen, and on the fetters of sleds, on the paw of the bear, and on the tongue of Bray, on the claws of the wolf, and on the beak of the eagle, on bloody wings, and on the supports of the bridge; on the redeeming palm, and the track of grace, on glass and on gold, and on the fortunes of men, in wine and beerwort, and the comfortable seat,

on the point of Gongen, and on the breast of Grane, on the nail of a norn, and on the beak of an owl; all were shaved off, [of] those that [earlier] were carved on, and thrown into the holy mead, and sent [out] on wide ways:

They are among ease, they are among elves, some among wise wanes, some have manly men.
