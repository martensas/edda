BPA Svá sęgja menn í fornum sǫgum, at ęinnhvęrr af ǫ́sum, sá es Hęimdallr hét, fór fęrðar sinnar ok framm með sjóvarstrǫndu nǫkkurri, kom at ęinum húsabǿ ok nęfndisk Rígr; ęptir þęiri sǫgu es kvę́ði þetta.EPA

BPB Thus say men in ancient \inx[C]{saw}[saws], that one of the \inx[G]{Ease}—he who was called \inx[P]{Homedall}—went on his journey forth along some lakeshore, came upon a lone homestead and called himself Righ. According to that saw is this poem:EPB

\bva Ár kvǫ́ðu ganga \hld\ grǿnar brautir &
ǫflgan ok aldinn \hld\ ǫ́s kunnigan, &
ramman ok rǫskvan \hld\ Ríg stíganda.\eva

\bvb Of yore they said did walk the green paths, a mighty and aged \inx[G]{Ease}[os], cunning; the strong and brisk Righ, striding.\evb

\bvg
\bva Gekk hann męir at þat \hld\ miðrar brautar, &
kom hann at húsi, \hld\ hurð vas á gę́tti; &
inn nam at ganga, \hld\ eldr vas á golfi, &
hjón sǫ́tu þar \hld\ hǫ́r at arni, &
Ái ok Edda \hld\ aldinfalda.\eva

\bvb Went he further at that, on the middle of the road; came he to a house; the door was wide open. He took to go inside; fire was on the floor. A couple sat there, hoary by the hearth: Great Grandfather and Great Grandmother, old-fashioned.\evb
