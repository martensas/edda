Dumezil hypothesis. Irish influence? Many interesting things to write here!

The language of \Rigsthula\ is highly formulaic, but also often unique to it. Of particular note are the alliteration between the adverb \emph{męir} ‘further’ and \emph{miðra}, e.g. in st. 2/1: \emph{gekk męir at þat}

\bpa Svá sęgja menn í fornum sǫgum, at ęinn-hvęrr af ǫ́sum, sá es Hęimdallr hét, fór fęrðar sinnar ok framm með sjóvar-strǫndu nǫkkurri, kom at ęinum húsa-bǿ ok nęfndisk Rígr; ęptir þęiri sǫgu es kvę́ði þetta.\epa

\bpb So say men in ancient \inx[C]{saw}[saws] that one of the \inx[G]{Ease}, he who was called \inx[P]{Homedall}, went on his journey and came forth along a certain lake shore, came upon a lone homestead and called himself Righ—according to that saw is this poem.\epb

\bva Ár kvǫ́ðu ganga \hld\ grǿnar brautir &
ǫflgan ok aldinn \hld\ ǫ́s kunnigan, &
ramman ok rǫskvan \hld\ Ríg stíganda.\eva

\bvb Of yore, they said, did walk on green paths \\
a mighty and aged \inx[G]{Ease}[os], cunning: \\
the strong and brisk Righ, striding.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Gekk męir at þat \hld\ miðrar brautar, &
kom hann at húsi, \hld\ hurð vas á gę́tti; &
inn nam at ganga, \hld\ ęldr vas á golfi, &
hjón sǫ́tu þar \hld\ hǫ́r at arni, &
Ái ok Ędda \hld\ aldin-falda.\eva

\bvb Went he further after that on the middle of the road, \\
came he to a house—the door was wide open. \\
He took to go inside, fire was on the floor. \\
A couple sat there, hoary by the hearth: \\
Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmother, old-fashioned.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Rigr kunni þęim \hld\ rǫ́ð at sęgja; &
męir sęttisk hann \hld\ miðra flętja &
en á hlið hvára \hld\ hjón sal-kynna.\eva

\bvb Righ knew to tell them counsels, \\
he further set himself down on the middle of the floor-bench, \\
and on either side: the couple of the hall.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þá tók Ędda \hld\ økkvinn hlęif, &

soð vas í bolla \hld\ sętti á bjóð; &
vas kalfr soðinn \hld\ krása bętstr; &
ręis hann upp þaðan, \hld\ réðsk at sofna;\eva

\bvb Then took Great-Grandmother a lumpy loaf, \\
heavy and thick, stuffed with chaff. \\
She carried it further after that on the middle of a trencher; \\
broth was in the bowl—she set it on a plate— \\
a cooked calf was the best dainty; \\
he \ken*{= Righ} rose up thence, resolved to sleep.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Rigr kunni þęim \hld\ rǫ́ð at sęgja; &
męir lagðisk hann \hld\ miðrar rękkju, &
en á hlið hvára \hld\ hjón salkynna.\eva

\bvb Righ knew to tell them counsels; \\
further he laid himself down in the middle of the bed, \\
and on either side: the couple of the hall.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þar vas hann at þat \hld\ þríar nę́tr saman; &
gekk hann męir at þat \hld\ miðrar brautar; &
liðu męir at þat \hld\ mǫ́nuðr níu.\eva

\bvb There he was after that for three nights in all; \\
went he further after that on the middle of the road; \\
passed further after that nine months.\evb
\evg

\edtrans{hǫrund-svartan}{swarthy of skin}{\Afootnote{\emph{emend.}; hǫrvi svartan ‘swarthy with flax’ \Wormianus}}, \hld\ hétu Þrę́l.\eva

\bvb A child Great-Grandmother begot; they poured it with water\footnoteB{A reference to the Heathen naming ceremony, somewhat resembling the Christian baptism, wherein water would be poured on a newborn. Cf. \Havamal\ 156.}— \\
swarthy of skin—they called it Thrall.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Hann nam at vaxa \hld\ ok vęl dafna; &
vas þar á hǫndum \hld\ hrokkit skinn, &
kropnir knúar, \hld\ [...] &
fingr digrir, \hld\ fúlligt andlit, &
lotr hryggr, \hld\ langir hę́lar.\eva

\bvb He began to grow, and thrive well; \\
there on his hands was wrinkled skin, \\
crooked knuckles, [...], \\
thick fingers, a foul face, \\
a stooping back, long heels.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Nam męir at þat \hld\ magns of kosta, &
bast at binda, \hld\ byrðar gørva; &
bar hęim at þat \hld\ hrís gęrstan dag.\eva

\bvb He began further after that to try his power: \\
bast to bind, burdens to make, \\
he carried home after that brushwood on a gloomy day.\footnoteB{The thrall had to work in even the most hostile weather.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þar kom at garði \hld\ \edtrans{gęngil-bęina}{gangle-boned woman}{\Bfootnote{Derogatory, somebody who (due to povert) only travels by foot.}}, &

Unlike Thrall, it is not attested in any prose texts, but probably corresponds to OS \emph{thiwi} ‘maid(-servant)’, being further root-related to \emph{þéa \char`~ þjá} ‘to enthral’, Proto-Norse \textbf{þewaʀ} ‘servant’, OE \emph{þéow} ‘slave, servant’,.}}.\eva

\bvb There came to the farm a gangle-boned woman: \\
mud was on her footsoles, her arm sunburnt, \\
downturned was her face; she called herself Thew.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Męir sęttisk hǫ́n \hld\ miðra flętja, &

\bvb She further set herself down on the middle of the floor-bench; \\
beside her sat the son of the house \ken*{= Thrall}. \\
They spoke and whispered; made a bed— \\
Thrall and Thew—on hard-pressed days.\evb

\bvb Children they begot, they settled and were content. \\
I think that they were called Rame and Feesner, \\
Clour and Cledge, Chafser, Foulner, \\
Drumber, Digrald, Draught and Hazer, \\
Lout and Leggald. — They laid yard-fences, \\
dunged the fields, fed the swine, \\
kept the goats, dug the turf.\evb
