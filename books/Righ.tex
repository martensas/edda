\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Thule of Righ} (\Rigsthula) is an interesting poem.  It is only preserved in a single leaf in the C14th ms. \Wormianus, where it follows, and is written in the same hand, as the Prose Edda and four grammatical treatises.  Numerous leaves are unfortunately missing from \Wormianus—among them the conclusion to \Rigsthula.

The poem itself is difficult to date, but comes off as rather late.  The meter is also unusually free, and there are numerous 3-syllable lines.  \Rigsthula\ uses a highly formulaic language, with some unique expressions.  Of particular note are the alliteration between the adverb \emph{męirr} ‘further’ and \emph{miðra}, e.g. in st. 2/1: \emph{gekk męirr at þat}.

TODO: Dumezil three-part society, racial caste system, Irish influence. Many interesting things to write here!
