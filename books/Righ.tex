\bpa Svá sęgja menn í fornum sǫgum, at ęinnhvęrr af ǫ́sum, sá es Hęimdallr hét, fór fęrðar sinnar ok framm með sjóvarstrǫndu nǫkkurri, kom at ęinum húsabǿ ok nęfndisk Rígr; ęptir þęiri sǫgu es kvę́ði þetta.\epa

\bpb Thus say men in ancient \inx[C]{saw}[saws], that one of the \inx[G]{Ease}—he who was called \inx[P]{Homedall}—went on his journey forth along some lakeshore, came upon a lone homestead and called himself Righ. According to that saw is this poem.\epb
\epg


\bvg
\bva Ár kvǫ́ðu ganga \hld\ grǿnar brautir &
ǫflgan ok aldinn \hld\ ǫ́s kunnigan, &
ramman ok rǫskvan \hld\ Ríg stíganda.\eva

\bvb Of yore they said did walk the green paths, a mighty and aged \inx[G]{Ease}[os], cunning; the strong and brisk Righ, striding.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Gekk hann męir at þat \hld\ miðrar brautar, &
kom hann at húsi, \hld\ hurð vas á gę́tti; &
inn nam at ganga, \hld\ ęldr vas á golfi, &
hjón sǫ́tu þar \hld\ hǫ́r at arni, &
Ái ok Ędda \hld\ aldinfalda.\eva

\bvb Went he further at that, on the middle of the road; came he to a house; the door was wide open. He took to go inside; fire was on the floor. A couple sat there, hoary by the hearth: Great Grandfather and Great Grandmother, old-fashioned.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Rigr kunni þęim \hld\ rǫ́ð at sęgja; &
męir sęttisk hann \hld\ miðra flętja &
en á hlið hvára \hld\ hjón salkynna.\eva

\bvb Righ knew to tell them counsels; he further set himself down on the middle of the floor-bench, but on either side [sat] the couple of the hall.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þá tók Ędda \hld\ økkvinn hlęif, &
þungan ok þykkvan, \hld\ þrunginn sǫ́ðum, &
bar hǫ́n męir at þat \hld\ miðra skutla, &
soð vas í bolla \hld\ sętti á bjóð; &
vas kalfr soðinn \hld\ krása bęztr; &
ręis hann upp þaðan, \hld\ réðsk at sofna;\eva

\bvb Then took Great Grandmother a lumpy loaf, heavy and thick, stuffed with chaff. She carried it further at that on the middle of a trencher—broth was in the bowl—she set it on a plate; a cooked calf was the best dainty; he rose up thence, resolved to sleep.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Rigr kunni þęim \hld\ rǫ́ð at sęgja; &
męir lagðisk hann \hld\ miðrar rękkju, &
en á hlið hvára \hld\ hjón salkynna.\eva

\bvb Righ knew to tell them counsels; he further laid himself down in the middle of the bed, but on either side [lay] the couple of the hall.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þar vas hann at þat \hld\ þríar nę́tr saman; &
gekk hann męirr at þat \hld\ miðrar brautar; &
liðu męirr at þat \hld\ mǫ́nuðr níu.\eva

\bvb There was at that for nine nights in all; went he further at that, on the middle of the road; passed further at that nine months.\evb
\evg

\bva Jóð ól Ędda, \hld\ jósu vatni &
\edtext{hǫrundsvartan}{\lemma{hǫrundsvartan ‘swarthy of skin’}\Afootnote{\emph{emend.}; hǫrvi svartan ‘swarthy with flax’ \Wormianus}}, \hld\ hétu Þrę́l.\eva

\bvb Great Grandmother begot a child, they poured it with water\footnoteB{A reference to the Heathen naming ceremony, wherein water would be poured on a newborn (quite similar to the Christian baptism). Cf. \Havamal\ 156.}—swarthy of skin—they called him Thrall.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Hann nam at vaxa \hld\ ok vęl dafna; &
vas þar á hǫndum \hld\ hrokkit skinn, &
kropnir knúar, \hld\ [...] &
fingr digrir, \hld\ fúlligt andlit, &
lotr hryggr, \hld\ langir hę́lar.\eva

\bvb He took to grow, and thrive well; there on his hands was skin wrinkled, knuckles crooked, [...], fingers thick, a face foul, back stooping, heels long.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Nam hann męirr at þat \hld\ magns of kosta, &
bast at binda, \hld\ byrðar gørva; &
bar hann hęim at þat \hld\ hrís gęrstan dag.\eva

\bvb Took he further at that to try his power; bast to bind, burdens to make; he carried home at that brushwood on a dismal day.\footnote{The thrall had to work in even the most hostile weather.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þar kom at garði \hld\ \edtext{gęngilbęina}{\lemma{‘gangleboned woman’}\Bfootnote{Derogatory term for somebody that only travels on their legs.}}, &
aurr vas á iljum, \hld\ armr sólbrunninn, &
niðrbjúgt vas nęf, \hld\ nęfndisk \edtext{Þír}{\lemma{Þír ‘Thew’}\Bfootnote{The name probably means ‘maid-servant’ or ‘female slave’. Unlike Thrall, it is not attested in any prose texts, but probably corresponds to OS \emph{thiwi} ‘maid(-servant)’, being further root-related to \emph{þéa \char`~ þjá} ‘to enthral’, Proto-Norse \textbf{þewaʀ} ‘servant’, OE \emph{þéow} ‘slave, servant’,.}}.\eva

\bvb There came to the farm a gangleboned woman; mud was on her footsoles, her arm sunburnt; downturned was her face; she called herself Thew.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Męir settisk hǫ́n \hld\ miðra flętja, &
sat hjá hęnni \hld\ sonr húss, &
rǿddu ok rýndu, \hld\ rękkju gęrðu &
Þrę́ll ok Þír \hld\ þrungin dǿgr.\eva

\bvb She further set himself down on the middle of the floor-bench; beside her sat the son of the house \ken*{= Thrall}. They spoke and whispered; made a bed—Thrall and Thew—on hard-pressed days.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Bǫrn ólu þau, \hld\ bjuggu ok unðu; &

Lútr ok Leggjaldi; \hld\ lǫgðu garða, &
akra tǫddu, \hld\ unnu at svínum, &
gęita gę́ttu, \hld\ grófu torf.\eva

\bvb Children they begot, they settled and were content. I judge that they were called Ream and Feasner, Clour and Cleg, Chafser, Foulner, Drumber, Dighrald, Draught and Hazer, Lout and Leggald, they laid yard-fences, dunged fields, fed swine, tended to goats, dug turf.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Dǿtr vǫ́ru þę́r \hld\ Drumba ok Kumba, &

\bvb The daughters were Drumb and Cumb; .\evb
