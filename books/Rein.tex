\section{Introduction}

\textbf{The Speeches of Rein} (\Reginsmal) are preserved in \Regius, where they follow \Gripisspa and are introduced with a large initial and a near-illegible title.  The text clearly serves as the basis for \VolsungaSaga\ 14–15 and 17–18 (for ch. 16 see \Gripisspa), where sts. 1–2, 6 and 18 are cited.

In \Regius, \Reginsmal\ is the first of a group of three very similar “poems” in an unbroken narrative sequence which also includes \Fafnismal\ and \Sigrdrifumal, for which reason the whole group will be shortly discussed here.

The existence of these three “poems”—indeed their very names—is entirely a product of later philology, and to paraphrase Bellows, it is doubtful whether it is logically sound.  Although \Fafnismal\ is introduced by a title and large initial and thus separated from \Reginsmal, the distinction between \Fafnismal\ and \Sigrdrifumal\ is entirely arbitrary, and the two are continuous in the ms.  More importantly, none of the three poems is a unit, but throughout them one finds the same amalgamation of narrative prose and stanzas in \Fornyrdislag\ and \Ljodahattr.  It may be noted that the style of the \Ljodahattr\ stanzas is very similar throughout, and this may also be the case for the \Fornyrdislag-stanzas, so that we appear to be dealing with at least two long separate cycles treating the same overlapping story.  A particularly transparent example of overlap between sources is the speech of the tits in \Fafnismal\ (TODO: stanza numbers), where there is a perfect logical progression of thought if one only reads the stanzas in one meter, but which is lost if one reads both.

Since they are not three distinct poems (unlike say \Voluspa, \Grimnismal\ and \Vafthrudnismal), the whole group should be understood as a continuous narrative saw or \emph{prosimetrum}, where the redactor tells the story primarily through prose, with the stanzas are reserved for direct speech.  It is not improbable that this reflects some convention of oral storytelling.  In any case, this division into three poems has been retained in the present edition for reasons of convention and accessibility, but the reader is strongly encouraged to read the entire sequence in order.

\section{The Speeches of Rein}

\bpg\bpa Sigurðr gekk til stóðs Hjálp-reks ok kaus sér af hest einn er Grani var kallaðr síðan. Þá var kominn Reginn til Hjálp-reks, sonr Hreið-mars. Hann var hverjum manni hagari ok dvergr of vǫxt. Hann var vitr, grimmr ok fjǫl-kunnigr. Reginn veitti Sigurði fóstr ok kennslu ok elskaði hann mjǫk. Hann sagði Sigurði frá for·ellri sínu ok þeim at·burðum at Óðinn ok Hǿnir ok Loki hǫfðu komit til And-vara-fors; í þeim forsi var fjǫlði fiska. Einn dvergr hét And-vari; hann var lǫngum í forsinum í geddu líki ok fekk sér þar matar. „Otr hét bróðir várr,“ kvað Reginn, „er oft fór í forsinn í otrs líki. Hann hafði tekit einn lax ok sat á ár-bakkanum ok át blundandi. Loki laust hann með steini til bana. Þóttust ę́sir mjǫk heppnir verit hafa ok flógu belg af otrinum. Þat sama kveld sóttu þeir gisting til Hreið-mars ok sýndu veiði sína. Þá tóku vér þá hǫndum ok lǫgðum þeim fjǫr-lausn at fylla otr-belginn með gulli ok hylja útan ok með rauðu gulli. Þá sendu þeir Loka at afla gullsins. Hann kom til Ránar ok fekk net hennar ok fór þá til And-vara-fors ok kastaði netinu fyr gedduna en hon hljóp í netit. Þá mę́lti Loki:\epa

\bpb {\huge S}iward went to Helpric’s stable and thereof chose for himself one horse which was thenceforth called Grane. Then Rein, son of Rethmar, was come to Helpric. He was craftier than every man and a dwarf in stature; he was clever, cruel and \inx[C]{many-cunning}. Rein granted Siward fosterage and teaching, and loved him much. He told Siward about his parentage, and about the events that Weden, Heener and Lock had come to Andwaresforce; in that force was a multitude of fish. One dwarf was called Andware; he was for a long time in the force in the likeness of a pike and got his food there. “Otter was our brother called,” said Rein, “who often went forth in the force in the likeness of an otter. He had taken a salmon and sat on the riverbank and ate it with his eyes closed. Lock beat him with a stone to his death. The Eese thought themselves to have been very lucky and flayed the skin from the otter. The same evening they sought lodgings at Rethmar’s house, and showed their catch. Then we bound them and gave them as a life-ransom to fill the otter-skin with gold and cover even the outside with red gold. Then they sent Lock to procure the gold. He came to Ran and got her net, and then journeyed to Andwaresforce and threw the net in front of the pike, and it jumped into the net. Then spoke Lock:\epb\epg

\bpg\bpa Loki sá allt gull þat er And-vari átti. En er hann hafði fram reitt gullit, þá hafði hann eftir einn hring ok tók Loki þann af hánum. Dvergrinn gekk inn í steininn ok mę́lti:\epa

\bpb Lock saw all the gold which Andware owned. But when he had readied all the gold, then he still had one ring, and Lock took it from him. The dwarf went into the stone and spoke:\epb\epg

„Þat skal \alst{g}ull \hld\ es \alst{G}ustr átti &

\bpg\bpa Ę́sir reiddu Hreið-mari féit ok tráðu upp otr-belginn ok reistu á fǿtr; þá skyldu ę́sirnir hlaða upp gullinu ok hylja. En er þat var gørt gekk Hreið-marr framm ok sá eitt grana-hár ok bað hylja. Þá dró Óðinn framm hringinn And-vara-naut ok hulði hárit.\epa

\bpb The Eese readied the wealth for Rethmar and stuffed the otter-skin and raised it on its feet. Then the Eese should fill it up with gold and cover it. But when that was done Rethmar stepped forth, and saw a single whisker-strand and bade it be covered. Then Weden drew forth the ring Andwaresgift and covered the strand.\epb\epg

\bpb Fathomer and Rein demanded from Rethmar the kin-payment after Otter, their brother. He said no to it. But Fathomer ran the sword through Rethmar, his father, sleeping. Rethmar called on his daughters:\epb\epg

\bvb “Beget yet a daughter—quoth Rethmar—a wolf-minded lady, \\
if thou gettest no son by the prince. \\
Wed that maiden to a man of great need, \\
then \emph{her} son will avenge thy harm!\footnoteB{Rethmar’s last words foretell the life of Siward, whose mother, Hardise, would then be Lingheath’s daughter.}”\evb\evg


\bpg\bpa Þá dó Hreið-marr, en Fáfnir tók gullit allt. Þá beiddisk Reginn at hafa fǫður-arf sinn, en Fáfnir galt þar nei við. Þá leitaði Reginn ráða við Lyng-heiði, systur sína, hvernig hann skyldi heimta fǫður-arf sinn. Hon kvað:\epa

\bpb Then Rethmar died and Fathomer took all the gold. Then Rein begged to have his father’s inheritance, but Fathomer gave back a no. Then Rein sought counsel from Lingheath, his sister, over how he should take his father’s inheritance. She quoth:\epb\epg

\bpg\bpa Þessa hluti sagði Reginn Sigurði. Einn dag, er hann kom til húsa Regins, var hánum vel fagnat. Reginn kvað:\epa

\bpb Thereafter Siward was always with Rein, and he told Siward that Fathomer lay on the Gnit-heath and was in a Wyrm’s likeness; he owned the helm of awe by which all living things were frightened. Rein made Siward the sword called Gram; it was so sharp that he plunged it down into the Rhine, and let a lock of wool float down the stream, and it split the lock like it did the water. With that sword Siward split asunder the anvil of Rein; after that Rein urged Siward to slay Fathomer. He said:\epb\epg

It is mentioned already in Tacitus Germania ch. 6: \emph{acies per cuneos componitur} ‘their line of battle is drawn up in a wedge-like formation’.
In the legendary saws it has a particular association with Weden; according \Sogubrot\ it was taught by Weden to the Danish king Harold Hildtooth, who went on to win great victories with it.  At last his rival, the Swedish king Siward Ring, was also taught it, and went on to slay Harold at the battle of the Browolds (\emph{Brávęllir}).  Cf. \Sogubrot\ 8:
\emph{Brúni segir: „Svá lítst mér sem Hringr muni búinn at berjask ok hans lið. Hann hefir undarliga fylkt. Hann hefir svín-fylkt her sínum, ok mun eigi gott at berjask við hann.“

‘Brown says: “It seems to me that Ring is ready to fight, and his troop too. He has drawn up them in a wondersome way; he has drawn up his host in the swine-shape, and it will not be good to fight against him.
Then says king Harold: “Who will have taught Ring to draw up the flying wedge? I thought noone knew it save for me and Weden; or will Weden wish to fail in his giving me victory? [...]”’}}.\eva

But when Fathomer slithered over the trench, then Siward ran him through with the sword to the heart. Fathomer shook himself and struck his head and spurned. Siward leapt out of the trench, and then each of them saw the other. Fathomer quoth:\epb\epg
