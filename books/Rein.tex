\bpg\bpa Sigurðr gekk til stóðs Hjálpreks ok kaus sér af hest einn er Grani var kallaðr síðan. Þá var kominn Reginn til Hjálpreks, sonr Hreiðmars. Hann var hverjum manni hagari ok dvergr of vöxt. Hann var vitr, grimmr ok fjölkunnigr. Reginn veitti Sigurði fóstr ok kennzlu ok elskaði hann mjök. Hann sagði Sigurði frá forellri sínu ok þeim atburðum at Óðinn ok Hænir ok Loki höfðu komið til Andvarafors; í þeim forsi var fjölði fiska. Einn dvergr hét Andvari; hann var löngum í forsinum í geddu líki ok fekk sér þar matar. „Otr hét bróðir várr,“ kvað Reginn, „er oft fór í forsinn í otrs líki. Hann hafði tekið einn lax ok sat á árbakkanum ok át blundandi. Loki laust hann með steini til bana. Þóttuz æsir mjök heppnir verið hafa ok flógu belg af otrinum. Þat sama kveld sóttu þeir gisting til Hreiðmars ok sýndu veiði sína. Þá tóku vér þá höndum ok lögðum þeim fjörlausn at fylla otrbelginn með gulli ok hylja útan ok með rauðu gulli. Þá sendu þeir Loka at afla gullzins. Hann kom til Ránar ok fekk net hennar ok fór þá til Andvarafors ok kastaði netinu fyr gedduna en hon hljóp í netið. Þá mælti Loki:\epa

\bpb Siward went to Helpric’s stable and chose one horse, which was thereafter called Grane. Then Rein, son of Rethmar, was come to Helpric. He was more skilled than any man and a dwarf in stature. He was wise, cruel and feel-cunning. Rein fostered and taught Siward and love him very much. He told Siward about his own parents, and about the events that Weden, Heener and Lock had come to Andwareforce; in that force was a multitude of fish. A dwarf was named Andware; he was for a long time in the force in the likeness of a pike and got his food there. “Otter was our brother called,” said Rein, “who often journeyed in the force in the likeness of an otter. He had caught a salmon and sat on the riverbank and ate it with closed eyes Lock struck him with a stone unto his death. The Ease thought themselves to have been very lucky, and flayed the skin off the otter. The same evening they sought to pass the night at Rethmare’s house, and showed their catch. Then we bound them and proposed to them as a life-ransom that they would fill the otter-skin with gold, and also coat the outside with red gold. Then they sent Lock to get ahold of the gold. He came to Ran and got her net and then journeyed to Andwareforce and threw the net before the pike, and it jumped into the net. Then Lock spoke:”\epb\epg
