\textbf{Dating} \parencite{Sapp2022}: C10th (0.666)–early C11th (0.259)

\end{flushright}

\Reginsmal\ is the first of a group of three similarly structured “poems” in an unbroken narrative sequence; the other two are \Fafnismal\ and \Sigrdrifumal.  The division into three poems (indeed their very names) is a product of later philology, and as Bellows says, is perhaps not logically sound.  The manuscript headers serve more like chapter headers, and each poem combines poetry composed in \Ljodahattr\ or \Fornyrdislag\ with a large deal of prose.  The \Ljodahattr\ stanzas of \Reginsmal, \Fafnismal\ and \Sigrdrifumal\ are greatly alike in style, and probably originally derive from the same composition.  The \Fornyrdislag\ stanzas are clearly distinct.

The whole group is best described as a long \emph{prosimetrum}.  Indeed most of the narrative is carried by the prose while the poetry carries the dialogue, and it is futile to try to extract only the poetic parts.

\Reginsmal\ clearly serves as the basis for \VolsungaSaga\ 14–15 and 17–18 (for ch. 16 see \Gripisspa), where sts. 1–2, 6 and 18 below are quoted directly.

\bpg\bpa Sigurðr gekk til stóðs Hjálp-reks ok kaus sér af hest einn er Grani var kallaðr síðan. Þá var kominn Reginn til Hjálp-reks, sonr Hreið-mars. Hann var hverjum manni hagari ok dvergr of vǫxt. Hann var vitr, grimmr ok fjǫl-kunnigr. Reginn veitti Sigurði fóstr ok kennslu ok elskaði hann mjǫk. Hann sagði Sigurði frá for·ellri sínu ok þeim at·burðum at Óðinn ok Hǿnir ok Loki hǫfðu komit til And-vara-fors; í þeim forsi var fjǫlði fiska. Einn dvergr hét And-vari; hann var lǫngum í forsinum í geddu líki ok fekk sér þar matar. „Otr hét bróðir várr,“ kvað Reginn, „er oft fór í forsinn í otrs líki. Hann hafði tekit einn lax ok sat á ár-bakkanum ok át blundandi. Loki laust hann með steini til bana. Þóttust ę́sir mjǫk heppnir verit hafa ok flógu belg af otrinum. Þat sama kveld sóttu þeir gisting til Hreið-mars ok sýndu veiði sína. Þá tóku vér þá hǫndum ok lǫgðum þeim fjǫr-lausn at fylla otr-belginn með gulli ok hylja útan ok með rauðu gulli. Þá sendu þeir Loka at afla gullsins. Hann kom til Ránar ok fekk net hennar ok fór þá til And-vara-fors ok kastaði netinu fyr gedduna en hon hljóp í netit. Þá mę́lti Loki:\epa

\bpb Siward went to Helpric’s stable and thereof chose for himself one horse who was henceforth called Grane. Then Rein, son of Rethmar, was come to Helpric. He was more crafty than any man and a dwarf in stature; he was clever, cruel and \inx[C]{many-cunning}. Rein fostered and taught Siward and love him very much. He told Siward about his own parents, and about the events that Weden, Heener and Lock had come to Andwareforce; in that force was a multitude of fish. A dwarf was named Andware; he was for a long time in the force in the likeness of a pike and got his food there. “Otter was our brother called,” said Rein, “who often journeyed in the force in the likeness of an otter. He had caught a salmon and sat on the riverbank and ate it with closed eyes Lock struck him with a stone unto his death. The Eese thought themselves to have been very lucky, and flayed the skin off the otter. The same evening they sought to pass the night at Rethmar’s house, and showed their catch. Then we bound them and proposed to them as a life-ransom that they would fill the otter-skin with gold, and also cover the outside with red gold. Then they sent Lock to procure the gold. He came to Ran and got her net, and then journeyed to Andwareforce and threw the net in front of the pike, and it jumped into the net. Then spoke Lock:\epb\epg

\bpg\bpa Loki sá allt gull þat er And-vari átti. En er hann hafði fram reitt gullit, þá hafði hann eftir einn hring ok tók Loki þann af hánum. Dvergrinn gekk inn í steininn ok mę́lti:\epa

\bpb Lock saw all the gold which Andware owned. But when he had brought forth all the gold, then he had one ring left, and Lock took it off him. The dwarf went into the stone and spoke:\epb\epg


\bvg\bva „Þat skal \alst{g}ull \hld\ es \alst{G}ustr átti &

\bpg\bpa Ę́sir reiddu Hreið-mari féit ok tráðu upp otr-belginn ok reistu á fǿtr; þá skyldu ę́sirnir hlaða upp gullinu ok hylja. En er þat var gørt gekk Hreið-marr framm ok sá eitt grana-hár ok bað hylja. Þá dró Óðinn framm hringinn And-vara-naut ok hulði hárit.\epa

\bpb The Eese readied the wealth for Rethmar and stuffed the otter-skin and raised it on its feet. Then the Eese should fill it up with gold and cover it. But when that was done Rethmar stepped forth, and saw a single whisker-strand and bade it be covered. Then Weden drew forth the ring Andwaresgift and covered the strand.\epb\epg


\bvg\bva „\alst{G}ull ’s þér nú ręitt (kvað Loki) en þú \alst{g}jǫld hęfir &

For thy son no welfare will be made; \\

\bpg\bpa Fáfnir ok Reginn krǫfðu Hreið-mar nið-gjalda eptir Otr, bróður sinn. Hann kvað nei við. En Fáfnir lagði sverði Hreið-mar, fǫður sinn, sofanda. Hreið-marr kallaði á dǿtr sínar:\epa

\bpb Fathomer and Rein demanded from Rethmar the kin-payment after Otter, their brother. He said no to it. But Fathomer ran the sword through Rethmar, his father, sleeping. Rethmar called on his daughters:\epb\epg


\bvg\bva „\alst{L}yng-hęiðr ok \alst{L}ofn-hęiðr, \hld\ vitið mínu \alst{l}ífi farit! &

if thou getst no son by the prince; \\
find that maiden a man of great strength, \\
then \emph{her} son will avenge thy injury!”\evb\evg


\bpg\bpa Þá dó Hreið-marr, en Fáfnir tók gullit allt. Þá beiddisk Reginn at hafa fǫður-arf sinn, en Fáfnir galt þar nei við. Þá leitaði Reginn ráða við Lyng-heiði, systur sína, hvernig hann skyldi heimta fǫður-arf sinn. Hon kvað:\epa

\bpb Then Rethmar died and Fathomer took all the gold. Then Rein asked to have his father’s inheritance, but Fathomer gave back a no. Then Rein sought counsel from Lingheath, his sister, over how he should get his father’s inheritance. She quoth:\epb\epg

\bpg\bpa Þessa hluti sagði Reginn Sigurði. Einn dag, er hann kom til húsa Regins, var hánum vel fagnat. Reginn kvað:\epa

\bpb These things Rein said to Siward. One day when he came to Rein’s house he was greeted well. Rein quoth:\epb\epg

\bpg\bpa Sigurðr var þá jafnan með Regin ok sagði hann Sigurði at Fáfnir lá á Gnita-heiði ok var í orms líki. Hann átti ǿgis-hjalm er ǫll kvikvendi hrę́ddusk við. Reginn gerði Sigurði sverð er Gramr hét. Þat var svá hvasst at hann brá því ofan í Rín ok lét reka ullar-lagð fyr straumi ok tók í sundr lagðinn sem vatnit. Því sverði klauf Sigurðr í sundr steðja Regins. Eptir þat eggjaði Reginn Sigurð at vega Fáfni. Hann sagði:\epa

\bpb Then Siward was always with Rein, and he told Siward that Fathomer lay on the Gnit-heath in a Wyrm’s likeness; he owned the helm of awe by which all living things were frightened. Rein made for Siward the sword which is called Gram; it was so sharp that he plunged it down into the Rhine, and floated a lock of wool down the stream, and it split the lock like it did the water. With that sword Siward split asunder Rein’s anvil; after that Rein urged Siward to slay Fathomer. He said:\epb\epg

\bpb Helpric got Siward a ship-retinue in order to avenge his father. They caught a great storm, and tacked the ships outside of some rocky crags. A lone man stood on the crag and quoth:\epb\epg


\bvg\bva „Hvęrir ríða þar \hld\ Rę́fils hestum &

It is mentioned already in Tacitus Germania ch. 6: \emph{acies per cuneos componitur} ‘their line of battle is drawn up in a wedge-like formation’.
In the legendary saws it has a particular association with Weden; according \Sogubrot\ it was taught by Weden to the Danish king Harold Hildtooth, who went on to win great victories with it.  At last his rival, the Swedish king Siward Ring, was also taught it, and went on to slay Harold at the battle of the Browolds.  Cf. \Sogubrot\ 8:
\begin{quote}\emph{Brúni segir: „Svá lítst mér sem Hringr muni búinn at berjask ok hans lið. Hann hefir undarliga fylkt. Hann hefir svín-fylkt her sínum, ok mun eigi gott at berjask við hann.“

\begin{quote}‘Brown says: “It seems to me that Ring and his retinue are ready to fight. He has drawn up his troops strangely. He has drawn up his host in the swine-shape, and it will not be good to fight against him.
Then says king Harold: “Who will have taught Ring to draw up the flying wedge? I thought nobody to know it save for me and Weden, or does Weden wish to fail me in his gift of victory? [...]”’\end{quote}}}.\eva

There Siward made a great trench in the way, and Siward went down into it. And when Fathomer slithered off the gold he blew venom, and it flew over Siward’s head. But when Fathomer slithered over the trench, then Siward ran him through with the sword to the heart. Fathomer shook himself and struck his head and spurned. Siward leapt out of the trench, and then each of them saw the other. Fathomer quoth:\epb\epg
