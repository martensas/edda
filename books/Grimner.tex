% Introduction

The \textbf{Speeches of Grimner} are preserved whole in both \Regius\ and \AM.

The poem itself is surrounded by two long introductory prose narratives containing some very old motifs, which are here brought up in the notes. It’s hard to say for how long these texts have accompanied the poem (TODO: I may write about this in the Introduction, since this question is important for several other poems), but since they are found in both \Regius\ and \AM\ and contain these motifs it would seem that they are fairly old. Together with sts. 1–3 they form a frame narrative that gives additional meaning to the gnomic sts. enclosed within.

The gnomic sts. themselves, the meat of the poem, are mythological and often quite obscure. In this they align closely with other Eddic gnomic poems such as \Havamal, \Vafthrudnismal, \Sigrdrifumal, and \Allvismal.

Weden begins by listing the halls of the gods (4–17). This section has been discussed in detail by \textcite{deVries1952} TODO! who considers it corrupt. Specifically, he sees the second half of v. 4 as a later insert, since it does not elaborate on the “holy land” mentioned in the first half. \textcite{Jackson1995} has argued convincingly against this, showing how the first half serves as a generalized introduction to the list; the holy land is the dwelling-places of the gods.

After this list come several sts relating to Weden and his hall, Walhall (18–23). Mentioned are the preparation of food in Walhall (18), Weden’s wolves (19) and ravens (20), the river through which the dead have to wade (21) and the gate through which they have to pass (22), the count of doors in Walhall (23), the count of doors in Thunder’s hall Bilshirner (24), and two animals which stand on the hall and gnaw on the branches of the tree Leered (25–26). From the latter animal’s—the stag Oakthirner’s—horns droplets fall into Wharyelmer, which is the origin of all rivers (26).

This introduces a list of mythic rivers (27–28), ending with the waters through which Thunder must wade on his way to Ugdrassle (29). This leads to a list of the horses ridden by the other gods on their way to Ugdrassle (31) which is followed by a description of the roots of Ugdrassle (31), then its animals (32–36) the Walkirries (37), and beings associated with the sun and moon (38–40), the things created from Yimer’s body (41–42) with a digression on the significance of the \inx[P]{bloot} for men in the present (43, see note there!), the creation of the ship Shidebladner (44) and finally a list of the noblest of several categories of things and groups (45).

After these lists Weden utters an unclear st. invoking the gods (46), before listing many of his names and the circumstances in which they were used (47–50). He then turns to Garfrith, disappointed by the inhospitality and poor conduct of his former protégé, and predicts his imminent death (51–53). He finally reveals himself by his true name, daring Garfrith to face him (53). After this he repeats several of his names (54), and the poem ends.

In the final prose section we are told that Garfrith, after learning that he was torturing Weden, hurried up to take the god away from the fires, but tripped and fell on his sword and died. After this his son Eyner ruled for a long time.

\section{From the sons of king Reeding (\emph{Frá sonum Hrauðungs konungs})}

\bpg
\bpa[1a]\mssnote{\Regius~8v/31, \AM~3v/23}Hrauðungr konungr átti tvá sonu. Hét annarr Agnarr, enn annarr Geirrøðr.
Agnarr var tíu vetra enn Geirrøðr átta vetra. Þeir reru tveir á báti með dorgar sínar at smáfiski.
Vindr rak þá í haf út. Í náttmyrkri brutu þeir við land ok gingu upp; fundu kotbónda einn.
Þar vǫ́ru þeir um vetrinn. Kerling fostraði Agnar enn karl Geirrøð.
At vári fekk karl þeim skip. Enn er þau kerling leiddu þá til strandar, þá mę́lti karl einmę́li við Geirrøð.
Þeir fengu byr ok kvǫ́mu til stǫðva fǫður síns. Geirrøðr var fram í skipi.
Hann hljóp upp á land enn hratt út skipinu, ok mę́lti: ”Far þú þar er smyl hafi þik.”
Skipit rak út. Enn Geirrøðr gekk út til bǿjar; hánum var vel fagnat; þá var faðir hans andaðr.
Var þá Geirrøðr til konungs tekinn, ok varð maðr ágę́tr.\epa

\bpb King Reeding owned two sons. One was called Eyner, and the other Garfrith.
Eyner was ten winters old, and Garfrith eight winters. The two were rowing in a boat with their trolling-lines for small fishing.
The wind then drove them out into the sea. In the dark of night they crashed into land and walked up; they found a lone cottage-farmer.
There they were over the winter. The wife fostered Eyner, but the husband Garfrith.\footnoteB{The wife was Frie, and the husband Weden; this is clarified by the following prose. The motif of Weden preferring the youngest brother is also found in \Rigsthula.}
In the spring the husband gave them ships, but when they followed the farmer’s wife in leading them to the shore, the husband spoke privately with Garfrith.\footnoteB{Surely instructing him to push his brother out to sea.}
They got a good gust, and came to their father’s harbour. Garfrith was in the front of the ship.
He leapt up onto land and pushed out the ship, and spoke: ”Go thou whither the fiends may have thee!”
The ship drove out. But Garfrith walked towards the farm; he was welcomed well; by then his father was passed-on.
Then Garfrith was taken as king, and became an excellent man.\epb

\bpb Weden and Frie sat in \inx[L]{Lithshelf} and looked over all the Homes.\footnoteB{Very similar to the Longbeard Origin Myth (TODO: reference and elaborate).}
Weden spoke: “Seest thou Eyner, thy foster-son, where he begets children with the troll-woman in the cave?\footnoteB{This may relate to Frie’s role as love-goddess. Eyner is in any case a \inx[C]{degenerate} man, what one would call a ‘coomer’.}
But Garfrith, my foster-son, is king and now sits at land.”
Frie says: “He is such a meat-nithing that he tortures his guests if he judges too many are coming.”
Weden says that this is the greatest lie; they make a wager about this matter.
Frie sent her handmaid Full to Garfrith’s. She bade the king be wary, that he not be ended by that \inx[C]{many-cunning} man who was come in the land, and said that his sign was that no hound was so fierce that he would leap at him.
But that was the greatest vainglory that Garfrith were not meat-good, and yet he has that man seized, whom the hounds would not touch.
He was clad in a blue cloak, and called himself Grimner, and did not tell any more about himself, even though he was interrogated.
The king had him tortured that he would speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there for eight nights.
King Garfrith had a son ten winters old, and he was named Eyner after his brother.
Eyner walked up to Grimner, and gave him a full horn to drink, saying that the king did ill as he had him tortured without cause.
Grimner drank from it. Then the fire had come such that the cloak burned on Grimner. He quoth:\epb

\bvb Folkwong is the ninth, and there Frow decides \\
the choice of seats in the hall; \\
half the slain she chooses each day, \\
but half does Weden own.\footnoteB{This st. is cited and closely paraphrased in \Gylfaginning\ 24. — The roots of \emph{kjósa val} ‘choose the slain’ are the same as those in \inx[C]{walkirrie} (\emph{val-kyrja} ‘chooser of the slain’), and as Frow is a prominent goddess this would surely make her the chief walkirrie.
This is paralleled by \Sorlathattr, where Frow assumes the name \inx[C]{Gandle} (\emph{Gǫndul}, a name attested in several lists of walkirries; see \Voluspa\ 30 and Notes) and incites the legendary never-ending Conflict of the Headnings (\emph{Hjaðningavíg}).
In spite of this parallel, there are good reasons to believe that the chief walkirrie was \inx[C]{Frie}, Weden’s wife.
First, one of the functions of the walkirries is to bear ale to the Ownharriers (\Grimnismal\ 37). This mirrors royal Germanic banquets attested in heroic poetry, where the host’s wife or daughter would pour ale to his retainers and guests (the so-called ‘lady with a mead cup’ ritual; see \textcite{Enright1996} and \textcite{Riseley2014}). As Weden’s wife, we would expect Frie to have this role.
Second, at Balder’s funeral as attested in \Gylfaginning\ (TODO. chapter number), Weden rides with Frie and the Walkirries, while Frow rides alone with her cats. If she were chief walkirrie, it is rather strange that she should not ride with them.
Third, there are two separate myths where Frie and Weden contend over the fates of armies and men. These are the prose introduction to the present poem and the Longbeard origin myth (for which see Introduction to the present poem).}\evb

Many commentors (e.g. \textcite{FinnurEdda} and Sijmons and Gering (p. 208, TODO)) interpret this st. as relating to the frame narrative, so that Weden, still bound between the two fires, is wishing for the gods to rescue him. This, however, scarcely makes sense given its placement in the gnomic wisdom section of the poem, unless the whole surrounding section is taken to be a later “insert” (as supposed by Finnur) but there is no textual or internal support for that.
I believe instead, agreeing with Nordberg, that the st. refers to the cooking and eating of sacred stew in large cauldrons during the \inx[C]{bloot}, and Woulder’s role in the setting of the ritual fire (see Encyclopedia: Woulder and \parencite{afEdholm2009}). This interpretation is especially interesting when one considers the preceding sts. 41–42, which deal with the ordering of the world through the dismembering of the primordial sacrificial victim Yimer. It is well attested comparatively (see \parencite{Lincoln1986}—especially the first two chapters—for its Indo-European analogues) that the ritual sacrifice in the present was seen as a reenactment and continuation of the gods’ creation of the world in the mythic past through the previously mentioned primordial sacrifice, and these three sts. would seem to attest this view also in the Germanic tradition.}\evb

\bpb King Garfrith sat and had the sword about his knee, and it was brandished half-way up. But when he heard that Weden were come there, he stood up and would take Weden from the fire. The sword slipped out of his hand; the hilt pointed downwards. The king tripped and stooped forth, but the sword went through him, and he received his bane. Weden then disappeared, but Eyner was there king for a long while afterwards.\epb
