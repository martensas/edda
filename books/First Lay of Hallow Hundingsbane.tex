\bva Ár vas alda \hld\ þat’s arar gullu &
hnigu hęilǫg vǫtn \hld\ af Himinfjǫllum; &

Borghildr borit \hld\ í Brálundi.\eva

\bvb It was the beginning of \inx[C]{eld}[elds], as eagles shrieked; holy waters poured down from the Heavenfells; then Burhild in Browlund gave birth to Hallow the Great-hearted.\evb

þann bǫ́ðu fylki \hld\ frę́gstan verða &
ok buðlunga \hld\ bęztan þykkja.\eva

\bvb Night came in the settlement; norns came, those who did shape the prince’s life; that marshaller \name{= Hallow} they declared would become most renowned, and of kings seem the foremost.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Sneru þę́r af afli \hld\ ørlǫgþǫ́ttu &
þá’s borgir braut \hld\ í Brálundi; &

ok und mána sal \hld\ miðjan fęstu.\eva

\bvb They turned with their might the strands of \inx[C]{orlay}, as he broke cities in Browlund; they arranged golden bands, and under the moon's hall fastened [them in] the middle.\evb
