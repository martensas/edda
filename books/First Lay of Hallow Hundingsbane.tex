Ár vas alda \hld þat’s arar gullu
hnigu hęilǫg vǫtn \hld af Himinfjǫllum;
þá hafði Hęlga \hld inn hugumstóra
Borghildr borit \hld í Brálundi.

It was in the beginning of ages when eagles shrieked; holy waters poured down from the Heavenfells; then Burhild in Browlund gave birth to Hallow the Great-hearted.

Nótt varð í bǿ, \hld nornir kvǫ́mu,
þær’s ǫðlingi \hld aldr um skópu;
þann bǫ́ðu fylki \hld frægstan verða
ok buðlunga \hld bęztan þykkja.

It became night in the settlement, norns came, those who for the prince did shape alder; then they declared the leader of troops <= Hallow> [would] become most renowned, and of kings be considered the foremost.

Sneru þær af afli \hld ørlǫgþǫ́ttu
þá’s borgir braut \hld í Brálundi;
þær um gręiddu \hld gullinsímu
ok und mána sal \hld miðjan fęstu.

They turned with their might the strands of orlay†, as he broke cities in Browlund; they arranged golden bands, and under the moon's hall fastened them in the middle.
