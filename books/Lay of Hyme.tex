Þórr dró Miðgarðsorm

Thunder pulled the Middenyardsworm.

Ár valtívar \hld vęiðar nǫ́mu
ok sumblsamir \hld áðr saðir yrði,
hristu tęina \hld ok á hlaut sǫ́u,
fundu þęir at Ægis \hld ørkost hvera.

Of yore the wal-Tues had hunted game\footnotemark[1] and — banqueting before they might eat\footnotemark[1] — they shook the twigs and looked at the leat†; they found at Age’s a lacking choice of cauldrons.
\footnotetext[1]{Lit. ‘took game’}
\footnotemark[2]{Lit. ‘banquet-some before they might become sated’}

Sat bergbúi \hld barntęitr fyr,
mjǫk glíkr męgi \hld Miskorblinda,
lęit í augu \hld Yggs barn í þrá:
“þú skalt ǫ́sum \hld opt sumbl gęra!”

Sat the mountain-dweller there, gay like a child, much like the lad of Misherblind; the child of Ug [Thunder] looked into [his] eyes in defiance: “Thou shalt for the Ease oft’ hold banquets!”

Ǫnn fekk jǫtni \hld orðbæginn halr,
hugði at hefndum \hld hann næst við goð,
bað hann Sifjar ver \hld sér fǿra hver,
“þann’s ek ǫllum ǫl \hld yðr of hęita”.

Great toil for the ettin did the word-peevish man cause; he soon thought of revenge against the god: he asked the husband of Sif [Thunder] him to bring a cauldron, “the one with which I for you all might brew ale”.

Né þat mǫ́ttu \hld mærir tívar
ok ginnręgin \hld of geta hvęrgi,
unz af tryggðum \hld Týr Hlórriða
ástráð mikit \hld ęinum sagði:
