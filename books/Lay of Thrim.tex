Vręiðr vas þá Ving-Þórr \hld es hann vaknaði
ok síns hamars \hld of saknaði,
skegg nam at hrista, \hld skǫr nam at dýja,
réð Jarðar burr \hld um at þreifask.

Wroth was then Wing-Thunder when he woke, and of his hammer was bereaved; his beard he began to shake, his locks he began to pull; the son of Earth resolved to look around.

Ok hann þat orða \hld alls fyrst of kvað:
“Hęyrðu nú, Loki, \hld hvat ek nú mæli
es ęigi vęit \hld jarðar hvęrgi
né upphimins: \hld áss es stolinn hamri!”

And he that word, first of all did say: “Hear thou now, Lock, what I now speak, which nowhere is known, not of earth nor up-heaven: the os has been robbed of his hammer!”

Gengu þęir fagra \hld Fręyju túna
ok hann þat orða \hld allz fyrst of kvað:
“Muntu mér, Fręyja, \hld fjaðrhams ljá
ef ek mínn hamar \hld mætta’k hitta?”

Went they to the fair towns† of Frow, and he that word, first of all did say: “Wilt thou me, Frow, the feather-hame† lend, if I my hammer might find?”

Fręyja kvað:
“Þó mynda’k gefa þér \hld þótt ór gulli væri
ok þó sęlja \hld at væri ór silfri.”
Fló þá Loki, \hld fjaðrhamr dunði,
unz fyr útan kom \hld ása garða
ok fyr innan kom \hld jǫtna hęima. 

Frow quoth:
“I would yet give it to thee, though it were out of gold, and yet offer\footnotemark[1] it to thee, if it were out of silver.”\footnotemark[2] Then Lock flew — the feather-hame rustled — until outside he came of the yards of the Ease, and inside he came of the homes of the ettins.
\footnotetext[1]{\emph{sęlja} ‘sell’ here has its earlier meaning, cf. Gothic \emph{saljan} ‘\emph{opfern}; θύειν’ (Streitberg 1910, p. 116).}
\footnotetext[2]{Regaining the hammer is of such importance to the gods (cf. v. 17; without it the Ease stand powerless against an ettin invasion), that Frow would lend the feather-hame to the greedy and unreliable Lock, even if it were made out of solid gold or silver.}

Þrymr sat á haugi, \hld þursa dróttinn,
gręyjum sínum \hld gullbǫnd snøri
ok mǫrum sínum \hld mǫn jafnaði. 

Thrim sat on the high†, the lord of thurses; on his greyhounds the golden leashes he twisted, and on his mares the manes he cut even.

Þrymr kvað:
“Hvat es með ǫ́sum? \hld Hvat es með ǫlfum?
Hví estu ęinn kominn \hld í jǫtunhęima?”
[Loki kvað:]
“Illt es með ǫ́sum, \hld [illt es með ǫlfum!]\footnotemark[1]
Hęfir þú Hlórriða \hld hamar of folginn?”
\footnotetext[1]{Second half-line inserted in analogy with the first pair, regardless it is needed for metrical reasons.}

Thrim quoth:
“What is with the Ease? What is with the elves? Why art thou alone come into the Ettin-homes?”
[Lock quoth:]
“'Tis bad with the Ease, 'tis bad with the elves! Hast thou the hammer of Loride hidden?”

[Þrymr kvað:]
Ek hęfi Hlórriða \hld hamar of folginn
átta rǫstum \hld fyr jǫrð neðan;
hann ęngi maðr \hld aptr of hęimtir
nęma fǿri mér \hld Fręyju at kvæn.

[Thrim quoth:]
“I have the hammer of Loride hidden, eight rests† beneath the earth; it no man will fetch again, unless he bring me Frow as wife.”

Fló þá Loki, \hld fjaðrhamr dunði,
unz fyr útan kom \hld jǫtna hęima
ok fyr innan kom \hld ása garða;
mǿtti hann Þór \hld miðra garða
ok þat hann orða \hld allz fyrst of kvað:
“Hęfir þú ørendi \hld sem ęrfiði?”

Then Lock flew — the feather-hame rustled — until outside he came of the homes of the ettins, and inside he came of the yards of the Ease. He met Thunder in the middle of the yards, and he that word, first of all did say: “Hast thou an errand, like hardship?

Segðu á lopti \hld lǫng tíðendi!
Opt sitjanda \hld sǫgur of fallask
ok liggjandi \hld lygi of bęllir.”

Say thou into the air the long news! Often [when] sitting, tales fail each other, and [when] lying down, lies are dealt.\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{Prob. a proverb, the meaning being that if one sits down and thinks too much over bad news, uncomfortable details will be smoothed over. Thus it is best that Lock immediately tell Thunder what he has learned.}

Hefi ek ørindi \hld erfiði ok:
Þrymr hęfir þinn hamar, \hld þursa dróttinn;
hann ęngi maðr \hld aptr of hęimtir
nęma hǫ́num fǿri \hld Fręyju at kvæn.

I have an errand, hardship also: Thrim has thy hammer, the lord of thurses; it no man will fetch again, unless he bring him Frow as wife.
