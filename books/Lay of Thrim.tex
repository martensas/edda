Vręiðr vas þá Ving-Þórr \hld es hann vaknaði
ok síns hamars \hld of saknaði,
skegg nam at hrista, \hld skǫr nam at dýja,
réð Jarðar burr \hld um at þreifask.

Wroth was then Wing-Thunder when he woke, and of his hammer was bereaved; his beard he began to shake, his locks he began to pull; the son of Earth decided to look around.

Ok hann þat orða \hld alls fyrst of kvað:
“Hęyrðu nú, Loki, \hld hvat ek nú mæli
es ęigi vęit \hld jarðar hvęrgi
né upphimins: \hld áss es stolinn hamri!”

And he that word, first of all did say: “Hear thou now, Lock, what I now speak, which nowhere is known, not of earth nor up-heaven: the os has been robbed of his hammer!”

Gengu þęir fagra \hld Fręyju túna
ok hann þat orða \hld allz fyrst of kvað:
“Muntu mér, Fręyja, \hld fjaðrhams ljá
ef ek mínn hamar \hld mætta’k hitta?”

Went they to the fair towns† of Frow, and he that word, first of all did say: “Wilt thou me, Frow, the feather-hame† lend, if I my hammer might find?”

Fręyja kvað:
“Þó mynda’k gefa þér \hld þótt ór gulli væri
ok þó sęlja \hld at væri ór silfri.”
Fló þá Loki, \hld fjaðrhamr dunði,
unz fyr útan kom \hld ása garða
ok fyr innan kom \hld jǫtna hęima. 

Frow quoth:
“I would yet give it to thee, though it were out of gold, and yet offer\footnotemark[1] it to thee, if it were out of silver.”\footnotemark[2] Then Lock flew — the feather-hame rustled — until outside he came of the yards of the Ease, and inside he came of the homes of the ettins.
\footnotetext[1]{\emph{sęlja} ‘sell’ here has its earlier meaning, cf. Gothic \emph{saljan} ‘\emph{opfern}; θύειν’ (Streitberg 1910, p. 116).}
\footnotetext[2]{Regaining the hammer is of such importance to the gods (cf. v. 17; without it the Ease stand powerless against an ettin invasion) that Frow would lend the feather-hame to the greedy and unreliable Lock, even if it were made out of solid gold or silver.}

Þrymr sat á haugi, \hld þursa dróttinn,
gręyjum sínum \hld gullbǫnd snøri
ok mǫrum sínum \hld mǫn jafnaði. 

Thrim sat on the high†, the lord of thurses; on his greyhounds the golden leashes he twisted, and on his mares the manes he cut even.
