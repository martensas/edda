\bva \edtext{\alst{V}ręiðr}{\lemma{Vręiðr}\Afootnote{}} vas þá Ving-Þórr \hld\ es hann vaknaði &
ok síns hamars \hld\ of saknaði, &
skegg nam at hrista, \hld\ skǫr nam at dýja, &
réð Jarðar burr \hld\ umb at þreifask.\eva

\bvb Wroth was then Wing-Thunder when he woke, and of his hammer was bereaved. His beard he took to shake, his locks he took to pull; resolved the son of Earth to look about.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ok hann þat orða \hld\ allz fyrst of kvað: &
“Hęyrðu nú, Loki, \hld\ hvat ek nú mæli &
es ęigi vęit \hld\ jarðar hvęrgi &
né upphimins: \hld\ áss es stolinn hamri!”\eva

\bvb And he that word, first of all did speak: “Hear thou now, Lock, what I now speak, which nowhere is known, not on earth nor \inx{up-heaven}{T}: the \inx{Os}[T] \ken{Thunder}[1] has been robbed of his hammer!”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Gengu þęir fagra \hld\ Fręyju túna &
ok hann þat orða \hld\ allz fyrst of kvað: &
“Muntu mér, Fręyja, \hld\ fjaðrhams ljá &
ef ek mínn hamar \hld\ mætta’k hitta?”\eva

\bvb Went they to the fair yards of Frow, and he that word, first of all did speak: “Wilt thou me, Frow, the \inx{feather-hame}{P} lend, if I my hammer might find?”\evb
\evg


\bvg {\small [Fręyja kvað:]}
\bva “Þó mynda’k gefa þér \hld\ þótt ór gulli væri &
ok þó sęlja \hld\ at væri ór silfri.” &
Fló þá Loki, \hld\ fjaðrhamr dunði, &
unz fyr útan kom \hld\ ása garða &
ok fyr innan kom \hld\ jǫtna hęima.\eva

\bvb Frow quoth: “I would yet give it to thee, though it were out of gold, and yet offer\footnoteB{\emph{sęlja} ‘sell’ here has its earlier meaning, cf. Gothic \emph{saljan} ‘\emph{opfern}; θύειν’ (Streitberg 1910:116).} it to thee, if it were out of silver.”\footnoteB{Regaining the hammer is of such importance to the gods (cf. v. 17; without it the Ease stand powerless against the \inx{Ettins}{T}), that Frow would lend the feather-hame to the greedy and unreliable Lock, even if it were made out of solid gold or silver.} Flew then Lock\footnoteB{Though Thunder is the one asking for the hame (“\emph{my} hammer”), Lock is the one that takes off flying.}—the feather-hame rustled—until outside he came of the yards of the Ease, and inside he came of the homes of the Ettins.
\evg

\bvg
\bva Þrymr sat á haugi, \hld\ þursa dróttinn, &
gręyjum sínum \hld\ gullbǫnd snøri &
ok mǫrum sínum \hld\ mǫn jafnaði.\eva

\bvb Thrim sat on the mound, the lord of thurses: on his greyhounds the golden leashes he twisted, and on his mares the manes he cut even.\evb
\evg


\bvg {\small [Þrymr kvað ok Loki:]}
\bva »Hvat es með ǫ́sum? \hld\ Hvat es með ǫlfum? &
Hví estu ęinn kominn \hld\ í jǫtunhęima?» &
»Illt es með ǫ́sum, \hld\ [illt es með ǫlfum!]\footnoteB{Second half-line inserted in analogy with the first pair, regardless it is needed for metrical reasons.} &
Hęfir þú Hlórriða \hld\ hamar of folginn?»\eva

\bvb [Thrim quoth:] “What is with the Ease? What is with the elves? Why art thou alone come into the Ettin-homes?” [Lock quoth:] “’Tis ill with the Ease, ’tis ill with the elves! Hast thou the hammer of Loride hidden?”\evb
\evg


\bvg {\small [Þrymr kvað ok Loki:]}
\bva Ek hęfi Hlórriða \hld\ hamar of folginn &
átta rǫstum \hld\ fyr jǫrð neðan; &
hann ęngi maðr \hld\ aptr of hęimtir &
nęma fǿri mér \hld\ Fręyju at kvæn.\eva

\bvb [Thrim quoth:] “I have the hammer of Loride hidden, eight \inx{rests} beneath the earth; it no man will fetch again, lest he bring me Frow as wife.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Fló þá Loki, \hld\ fjaðrhamr dunði, &
unz fyr útan kom \hld\ jǫtna hęima &
ok fyr innan kom \hld\ ása garða; &
mǿtti hann Þór \hld\ miðra garða &
ok þat hann orða \hld\ allz fyrst of kvað: &
Hęfir þú ørendi \hld\ sem ęrfiði?\eva

\bvb Flew then Lock—the feather-hame rustled—until outside he came of the homes of the Ettins, and inside he came of the yards of the Ease. He met Thunder in the middle of the yards, and he that word, first of all did say: “Hast thou an errand, as hardship\footnoteB{A difficult phrase to translate; Thunder asks Lock if he has bad news.}?\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Segðu á lopti \hld\ lǫng tíðendi! &
Opt sitjanda \hld\ sǫgur of fallask &
ok liggjandi \hld\ lygi of bęllir.\eva

\bvb Say thou aloft, the long tidings! Often [when] sitting, tales fail each other, and [when] lying down, lies are dealt.”\footnoteB{Proverbial, meaning being that if one sits down and thinks too much over bad news, things will be left out, excuses thought up. Thus it is best that Lock immediately tell Thunder what he has learned.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Hefi ek ørindi \hld\ erfiði ok: &
Þrymr hęfir þinn hamar, \hld\ þursa dróttinn; &
hann ęngi maðr \hld\ aptr of hęimtir &
nęma hǫ́num fǿri \hld\ Fręyju at kvæn.\eva

\bvb [Lock quoth:] “I have an errand, hardship also: Thrim has thy hammer, the lord of thurses; it no man will fetch again, lest he bring him Frow as wife.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ganga þęir fagra \hld\ Fręyju at hitta
ok hann þat orða \hld\ allz fyrst of kvað:
Bittu þik, Fręyja, \hld\ brúðar líni!
Vit skulum aka tvau \hld\ í jǫtunhęima.\eva

\bvb Go they the fair Frow to find, and he that word, first of all did say: “Bind thee, Frow, with a bride’s linen\footnoteB{A linen band tied around the bride’s head. TODO: Reference this note.}! We two shall drive into the Ettin-homes.”\evb

Vręið varð þá Fręyja \hld\ ok fnasaði,
allr ása salr \hld\ undir bifðisk,
stǫkk þat it mikla \hld\ męn Brísinga:
Mik vęiztu verða \hld\ vergjarnasta
ef ek ęk með þér \hld\ í jǫtunhęima.

Wroth became then Frow, and snorted; all the halls of the Ease trembled below; she threw off the mighty necklace of the Brisings: “Thou knowest that I will become the most man-eager, if I drive with thee into the Ettin-homes.”

Senn vǫ́ru æsir \hld\ allir á þingi
ok ásynjur \hld\ allar á máli,
ok of þat réðu \hld\ ríkir tívar
hvé þęir Hlórriða \hld\ hamar of sǿtti.

Soon the Ease were all at the Thing, and the Osennies all at speech, and of that decided the rich Tues: how they the hammer of Loride would regain\footnotemark[1].
\footnotetext[1]{\emph{sǿkja} ‘attack, seek’; they decide how to handle the hammer issue.}

Þá kvað þat Heimdallr, \hld\ hvítastr ása,
vissi hann vel fram \hld\ sęm vanir aðrir:
“Bindu vér Þór þá \hld\ brúðar líni;
hafi hann it mikla \hld\ męn Brísinga!

Then quoth that Homedall, the whitest of the Ease — he knew well the future, like the other Wanes —: “Let us bind Thunder with the bride’s linen; he may have the great necklace of the Brisings.

Lǫ́tum und hǫ́num \hld\ hrynja lukla
ok kvenváðir \hld\ umb kné falla
en á brjósti \hld\ bręiða stęina
ok hagliga \hld\ umb hǫfuð typpum!”

Let us have by him jingling keys\footnotemark[1], and women’s garments falling down about his knees, but on the breast broad stones\footnotemark[2], and skillfully let us tip his head!\footnotemark[3]”
\footnotetext[1]{As the everyday manager of the household, keys were the mark of the married housewife.}
\footnotetext[2]{Large jewels.}
\footnotetext[3]{With a (pointed) hood.}

Þá kvað þat Þórr, \hld\ þrúðugr áss:
“Mik munu æsir \hld\ argan kalla
ef ek bindask læt \hld\ brúðar líni!”

Then quoth that Thunder, the mighty os: “\emph{Me}, the Ease would call an arrow† man, if I let myself be bound with bride’s linen!”

Þá kvað þat Loki \hld\ Laufęyjar sonr:
“Þęgi þú, Þórr, \hld\ þęira orða!
Þegar munu jǫtnar \hld\ Ásgarð búa
nęma þú þinn hamar \hld\ þér of hęimtir.”

Then quoth that Lock, the son of Leafie: “Speak not, Thunder, those words!\footnotemark[1] Shortly the ettins will Osyard inhabit, unless thou thy hammer for thyself dost fetch!”
\footnotetext[1]{Lit. “Be silent thou, Thunder, of those words!”}

Bundu þęir Þór þá \hld\ brúðar líni
ok inu mikla \hld\ męni Brísinga,
létu und hǫ́num \hld\ hrynja lukla
ok kvenváðir \hld\ umb kné falla
ęn á brjósti \hld\ bręiða stęina
ok hagliga \hld\ of hǫfuð typpðu.

Bound they Thunder then, with bride’s linen, and with the great necklace of the Brisings. They had by him keys jingling, and women’s garments falling down to his knees, but on the breast broad stones, and skillfully they tipped his head.

Þá kvað þat Loki \hld\ Laufęyjar sonr:
“Mun ek ok með þér \hld\ ambǫ́tt vesa,
vit skulum aka tvau \hld\ í jǫtunhęima!”

Then quoth that Lock, the son of Leafie: “I will also with thee be a handmaid; we two\footnotemark[1] shall drive into the Ettin-homes.”
\footnotetext[1]{The form used, \emph{tvau}, is the neuter plural, ie. one of the pair is female and the other male. This is either an error due to mindless copying of v. 11, or a backhanded insult against Thunder.}

Senn vǫ́ru hafrar \hld\ hęim of vreknir,
skyndir at skǫklum, \hld\ skyldu vel renna;
bjǫrg brotnuðu, \hld\ brann jǫrð loga,
ók Óðins sonr \hld\ í jǫtunhęima.

Soon he-goats were driven home, hasted onto the cart-poles; they were to run well. Crags burst, the earth burned with flame; the son of Weden drove into the Ettin-homes.\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{For a similar account of Thunder driving, see \emph{Haustlǫng}, v. 14-16 in \emph{Skp} 3 (pp. 453-456).}

Þá kvað þat Þrymr, \hld\ þursa dróttinn:
“Standið upp, jǫtnar, \hld\ ok stráið bękki!
Nú fǿrið mér \hld\ Fręyju at kván,
Njarðar dóttur \hld\ ór Nóatúnum.”

Then quoth that Thrim, the lord of thurses: “Stand ye up, ettins, and strew ye the benches! Now bring ye me Frow as wife, the daughter of Nearth of the Nowetowns.

Ganga hér at garði \hld\ gullhyrnðar kýr,
øxn alsvartir, \hld\ jǫtni at gamni,
fjǫlð á’k męiðma, \hld\ fjǫlð á’k męnja;
ęinnar mér Fręyju \hld\ ávant þykkir.

Here march to the estate golden-horned cows, all-black oxen, to the enjoyment of the ettin; a multitude I own of treasures, a multitude I own of necklaces; of Frow alone methinks is missing.”

Vas þar at kveldi \hld\ of komit snimma
ok fyr jǫtna \hld\ ǫl framm borit.
Ęinn át oxa, \hld\ átta laxa,
krásir allar, \hld\ þær’s konur skyldu,
drakk Sifjar verr \hld\ sáld þrjú mjaðar.

There was the evening come quickly, and for the ettins ale brought forth. [Thunder] ate one ox, eight salmons, and all the delicacies, which the women were supposed to; drank the husband of Sib \ken{Thunder}[1] three sieves of mead.\Bfootnote{Compare \Hymiskvida\ 15 for a strikingly similar description of Thunder’s great eating.}

Þá kvað þat Þrymr, \hld\ þursa dróttinn:
“Hvar sáttu brúðir \hld\ bíta hvassara?
Sá’k-a brúðir \hld\ bíta ęnn bręiðara
né ęnn męira mjǫð \hld\ męy of drekka!”

Then quoth that Thrim, the lord of thurses: “Where sawest thou brides bite sharper? Saw I never brides bite yet broader, nor yet more mead a maiden drink.”

Sat in alsnotra \hld\ ambǫ́tt fyr
es orð of fann \hld\ við jǫtuns máli:
“Át vætr Fręyja \hld\ átta nóttum,
svá var hón óðfús \hld\ í jǫtunhęima.”

Sat the allclever maid-servant\footnotemark[1] in front, when she words did find against the speech of the ettin: “\emph{Ate} Frow nought, for eight nights; so mad was her longing for the Ettin-homes.\footnotemark[2]”
\footnotetext[1]{Lock in disguise.}
\footnotetext[2]{Lit. “so was she mad-desirious [to come] into the Ettin-homes.”}

Laut und línu, \hld\ lysti at kyssa,
ęn hann útan stǫkk \hld\ ęndlangan sal:
“Hví eru ǫndótt \hld\ augu Fręyju?
Þykki mér ór \hld\ augum brenna!”

He looked ’neath the linen, he lusted for a kiss, but he from the outside leapt back, across the length of the hall: “Why are the eyes of Frow fiery? Methinks there is fire coming out of the eyes!\footnotemark[1]”
\footnotetext[1]{Lit. “Methinks out of the eyes burn.”}

Sat in alsnotra \hld\ ambǫ́tt fyr\footnotemark[1]
es orð of fann \hld\ við jǫtuns máli:
“Svaf vætr Fręyja \hld\ átta nóttum,
svá var hón óðfús \hld\ í jǫtunhęima.”
\footnotetext[1]{In the ms. this word (abbreviated as \emph{f.}) is followed by \emph{ſ.}; the meaning is unclear (perhaps a word starting with \emph{s-} was originally spelled out in v. 25?) and it has thus been discarded.}

Sat the allclever maid-servant in front, when she words did find against the speech of the ettin: “\emph{Slept} Frow nought, for eight nights; so mad was her longing for the Ettin-homes.”

Inn kom in arma \hld\ jǫtna systir,
hin es brúðfjár \hld\ biðja þorði:
“Láttu þér af hǫndum \hld\ hringa rauða
ef þú ǫðlask vill \hld\ ástir mínar,
ástir mínar, \hld\ alla hylli!”

In came the wretched sister of the ettins, the one who for the bride-price had dared ask: “Take off from thy hands the red rings, if thou wilt win my loves; my loves, [and] all favour.”\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{The sister, who already asked for the hammer, now has the audacity to ask “Frow” (Thunder) to take the rings off her hands and give them to her.}

Þá kvað þat Þrymr, \hld\ þursa dróttinn:
“Berið inn hamar \hld\ brúði at vígja,
leggið Mjǫllni \hld\ í męyjar kné,
vígið okkr saman \hld\ Várar hęndi!”

Then quoth that Thrim, the lord of thurses: “Bear ye in the hammer, the bride to bless; lay ye Mealen in the maiden’s knee, bless ye us two together by the hand of Ware\footnotemark[1]!”
\footnotetext[1]{A minor goddess, probably presiding over marriages.}

Hló Hlórriða \hld\ hugr í brjósti
es harðhugaðr \hld\ hamar of þękkði;
Þrym drap hann fyrstan, \hld\ þursa dróttin,
ok ætt jǫtuns \hld\ alla lamði.

The heart of Loride laughed in his breast, when, hard-hearted, he recognized the hammer. Thrim he slew first, the lord of thurses, and all the aught† of the ettin he thrashed.

Drap hann ina ǫldnu \hld\ jǫtna systur,
hin es brúðfjár \hld\ of beðit hafði;
hón skell of hlaut \hld\ fyr skillinga
en hǫgg hamars \hld\ fyr hringa fjǫlð.

He slew the old sister of the ettins, the one who for the bride-price had asked; she received a smiting before shillings, and a strike of the hammer before a multitude of rings.

Svá kom Óðins sonr \hld\ ęndr at hamri.

Thus the son of Weden regained his hammer.
