Vręiðr vas þá Ving-Þórr \hld es hann vaknaði
ok síns hamars \hld of saknaði,
skegg nam at hrista, \hld skǫr nam at dýja,
réð Jarðar burr \hld um at þreifask.

Wroth was then Wing-Thunder when he woke, and of his hammer was bereaved; his beard he began to shake, his locks he began to pull; the son of Earth decided to look around.

Ok hann þat orða \hld alls fyrst of kvað:
“Hęyrðu nú, Loki, \hld hvat ek nú mæli
es ęigi vęit \hld jarðar hvęrgi
né upphimins: \hld áss es stolinn hamri!”

And he that word, first of all did say: “Hear thou now, Lock, what I now speak, which nowhere is known, not on earth nor up-heaven: the os has been robbed of his hammer!”
