Vręiðr vas þá Ving-Þórr \hld es hann vaknaði
ok síns hamars \hld of saknaði,
skegg nam at hrista, \hld skǫr nam at dýja,
réð Jarðar burr \hld umb at þreifask.

Wroth was then Wing-Thunder when he woke, and of his hammer was bereaved; his beard he began to shake, his locks he began to pull; the son of Earth resolved to look about.

Ok hann þat orða \hld alls fyrst of kvað:
“Hęyrðu nú, Loki, \hld hvat ek nú mæli
es ęigi vęit \hld jarðar hvęrgi
né upphimins: \hld áss es stolinn hamri!”

And he that word, first of all did say: “Hear thou now, Lock, what I now speak, which nowhere is known, not of earth nor up-heaven: the os† has been robbed of his hammer!”

Gengu þęir fagra \hld Fręyju túna
ok hann þat orða \hld allz fyrst of kvað:
“Muntu mér, Fręyja, \hld fjaðrhams ljá
ef ek mínn hamar \hld mætta’k hitta?”

Went they to the fair towns† of Frow, and he that word, first of all did say: “Wilt thou me, Frow, the feather-hame† lend, if I my hammer might find?”

Fręyja kvað:
“Þó mynda’k gefa þér \hld þótt ór gulli væri
ok þó sęlja \hld at væri ór silfri.”
Fló þá Loki, \hld fjaðrhamr dunði,
unz fyr útan kom \hld ása garða
ok fyr innan kom \hld jǫtna hęima. 

Frow quoth:
“I would yet give it to thee, though it were out of gold, and yet offer\footnotemark[1] it to thee, if it were out of silver.”\footnotemark[2] Then Lock flew — the feather-hame rustled — until outside he came of the yards of the Ease, and inside he came of the homes of the ettins.\footnotemark[3]
\footnotetext[1]{\emph{sęlja} ‘sell’ here has its earlier meaning, cf. Gothic \emph{saljan} ‘\emph{opfern}; θύειν’ (Streitberg 1910, p. 116).}
\footnotetext[2]{Regaining the hammer is of such importance to the gods (cf. v. 17; without it the Ease stand powerless against an ettin invasion), that Frow would lend the feather-hame to the greedy and unreliable Lock, even if it were made out of solid gold or silver.}
\footnotemark[3]{Though Thunder is the one asking for the hame (“\emph{my} hammer”), Lock is the one that takes off flying.}

Þrymr sat á haugi, \hld þursa dróttinn,
gręyjum sínum \hld gullbǫnd snøri
ok mǫrum sínum \hld mǫn jafnaði. 

Thrim sat on the high†, the lord of thurses; on his greyhounds the golden leashes he twisted, and on his mares the manes he cut even.

Þrymr kvað:
“Hvat es með ǫ́sum? \hld Hvat es með ǫlfum?
Hví estu ęinn kominn \hld í jǫtunhęima?”
[Loki kvað:]
“Illt es með ǫ́sum, \hld [illt es með ǫlfum!]\footnotemark[1]
Hęfir þú Hlórriða \hld hamar of folginn?”
\footnotetext[1]{Second half-line inserted in analogy with the first pair, regardless it is needed for metrical reasons.}

Thrim quoth:
“What is with the Ease? What is with the elves? Why art thou alone come into the Ettin-homes?”
[Lock quoth:]
“'Tis ill with the Ease, 'tis ill with the elves! Hast thou the hammer of Loride hidden?”

[Þrymr kvað:]
Ek hęfi Hlórriða \hld hamar of folginn
átta rǫstum \hld fyr jǫrð neðan;
hann ęngi maðr \hld aptr of hęimtir
nęma fǿri mér \hld Fręyju at kvæn.

[Thrim quoth:]
“I have the hammer of Loride hidden, eight rests† beneath the earth; it no man will fetch again, unless he bring me Frow as wife.”

Fló þá Loki, \hld fjaðrhamr dunði,
unz fyr útan kom \hld jǫtna hęima
ok fyr innan kom \hld ása garða;
mǿtti hann Þór \hld miðra garða
ok þat hann orða \hld allz fyrst of kvað:
“Hęfir þú ørendi \hld sem ęrfiði?”

Then Lock flew — the feather-hame rustled — until outside he came of the homes of the ettins, and inside he came of the yards of the Ease. He met Thunder in the middle of the yards, and he that word, first of all did say: “Hast thou an errand, like hardship?\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{A difficult phrase to translate; Thunder asks Lock if he has bad news.}

Segðu á lopti \hld lǫng tíðendi!
Opt sitjanda \hld sǫgur of fallask
ok liggjandi \hld lygi of bęllir.”

Say thou into the air the long tidings! Often [when] sitting, tales fail each other, and [when] lying down, lies are dealt.”\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{Prob. a proverb, the meaning being that if one sits down and thinks too much over bad news, uncomfortable details will be smoothed over and excuses thought up. Thus it is best that Lock immediately tell Thunder what he has learned.}

[Loki kvað:]
Hefi ek ørindi \hld erfiði ok:
Þrymr hęfir þinn hamar, \hld þursa dróttinn;
hann ęngi maðr \hld aptr of hęimtir
nęma hǫ́num fǿri \hld Fręyju at kvæn.

[Lock quoth:]
“I have an errand, hardship also: Thrim has thy hammer, the lord of thurses; it no man will fetch again, unless he bring him Frow as wife.”

Ganga þęir fagra \hld Fręyju at hitta
ok hann þat orða \hld allz fyrst of kvað:
“Bittu þik, Fręyja, \hld brúðar líni!
Vit skulum aka tvau \hld í jǫtunhęima.”

Go they the fair Frow to find, and he that word, first of all did say: “Bind thee, Frow, with bride’s linen†! We two shall drive into the Ettin-homes.”

Vręið varð þá Fręyja \hld ok fnasaði,
allr ása salr \hld undir bifðisk,
stǫkk þat it mikla \hld męn Brísinga:
“Mik vęiztu verða \hld vergjarnasta
ef ek ęk með þér \hld í jǫtunhęima.”

Wroth became then Frow, and snorted; all the halls of the Ease trembled below; she dropped the necklace of the Brisings: “Thou knows that I will be called the most man-eager woman, if I drive with thee into the Ettin-homes.”

Senn vǫ́ru æsir \hld allir á þingi
ok ásynjur \hld allar á máli,
ok of þat réðu \hld ríkir tívar
hvé þęir Hlórriða \hld hamar of sǿtti.

Soon the Ease were all at the Thing, and the osennies all at speech, and of that decided the rich Tues†: how they the hammer of Loride would regain\footnotemark[1].
\footnotetext[1]{\emph{sǿkja} ‘attack, seek’; they decide how to handle the hammer issue.}

Þá kvað þat Heimdallr, \hld hvítastr ása,
vissi hann vel fram \hld sęm vanir aðrir:
“Bindu vér Þór þá \hld brúðar líni;
hafi hann it mikla \hld męn Brísinga!

Then quoth that Homedall, the whitest of the Ease — he knew well the future, like the other Wanes —: “Let us bind Thunder with the bride's linen; he may have the great necklace of the Brisings.

Lǫ́tum und hǫ́num \hld hrynja lukla
ok kvenváðir \hld umb kné falla
en á brjósti \hld bręiða stęina
ok hagliga \hld umb hǫfuð typpum!”

Let us have by him jingling keys\footnotemark[1], and women's garments falling down about his knees, but on the breast broad stones\footnotemark[2], and skillfully let us tip his head!\footnotemark[3]”
\footnotetext[1]{As the everyday manager of the household, keys were the mark of the married housewife.}
\footnotetext[2]{Large jewels.}
\footnotetext[3]{With a (pointed) hood.}

Þá kvað þat Þórr, \hld þrúðugr áss:
“Mik munu æsir \hld argan kalla
ef ek bindask læt \hld brúðar líni!”

Then quoth that Thunder, the mighty os: “\emph{Me}, the Ease would call an arrow† man, if I let myself be bound with bride’s linen!”

Þá kvað þat Loki \hld Laufęyjar sonr:
“Þęgi þú, Þórr, \hld þęira orða!
Þegar munu jǫtnar \hld Ásgarð búa
nęma þú þinn hamar \hld þér of hęimtir.”

Then quoth that Lock, the son of Leafie: “Speak not, Thunder, those words!\footnotemark[1] Shortly the ettins will Osyard inhabit, unless thou thy hammer for thyself dost fetch!”
\footnotetext[1]{Lit. “Be silent thou, Thunder, of those words!”}

Bundu þęir Þór þá \hld brúðar líni
ok inu mikla \hld męni Brísinga,
létu und hǫ́num \hld hrynja lukla
ok kvenváðir \hld umb kné falla
ęn á brjósti \hld bręiða stęina
ok hagliga \hld of hǫfuð typpðu.

Bound they Thunder then, with bride’s linen, and with the great necklace of the Brisings. They had by him keys to jingle, and women's garments to fall down to his knees, but on the breast broad stones, and skillfully they tipped his head.

Þá kvað þat Loki \hld Laufęyjar sonr:
“Mun ek ok með þér \hld ambǫ́tt vesa,
vit skulum aka tvau \hld í jǫtunhęima!”

Then quoth that Lock, the son of Leafie: “I will also with thee be a handmaid; we two\footnotemark[1] shall drive into the Ettin-homes.”
\footnotetext[1]{The form used, \emph{tvau}, is the neuter plural, ie. one of the pair is female and the other male. This is either an error due to mindless copying of v. 11, or a backhanded insult against Thunder.}

Senn vǫ́ru hafrar \hld hęim of vreknir,
skyndir at skǫklum, \hld skyldu vel renna;
bjǫrg brotnuðu, \hld brann jǫrð loga,
ók Óðins sonr \hld í jǫtunhęima.

Soon he-goats were driven home, hasted onto the cart-poles; they were to run well. Crags burst, the earth burned with flame; the son of Weden drove into the Ettin-homes.\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{For a similar account of Thunder driving, see \emph{Haustlǫng}, v. 14-16 in \emph{Skp} 3 (pp. 453-456).}

Þá kvað þat Þrymr, \hld þursa dróttinn:
“Standið upp, jǫtnar, \hld ok stráið bękki!
Nú fǿrið mér \hld Fręyju at kván,
Njarðar dóttur \hld ór Nóatúnum.”

Then quoth that Thrim, the lord of thurses: “Stand ye up, ettins, and strew the benches! Now bring ye me Frow as wife, the daughter of Nearth, out of Nowetowns.

Ganga hér at garði \hld gullhyrnðar kýr,
øxn alsvartir, \hld jǫtni at gamni,
fjǫlð á’k męiðma, \hld fjǫlð á’k męnja;
ęinnar mér Fręyju \hld ávant þykkir.

Here march to the estate golden-horned cows, all-black oxen, to the enjoyment of the ettin; a multitude I own of treasure, a multitude I own of necklaces; of Frow alone methinks is missing.”

Vas þar at kveldi \hld of komit snimma
ok fyr jǫtna \hld ǫl framm borit.
Ęinn át oxa, \hld átta laxa,
krásir allar, \hld þær’s konur skyldu,
drakk Sifjar verr \hld sáld þrjú mjaðar. 

There was the evening come quickly, and for the ettins ale brought forth. [Thunder] ate one ox, eight salmons, and all the delicacies, which the women were supposed to; drank the husband of Sif three sieves of mead.

Þá kvað þat Þrymr, \hld þursa dróttinn:
“Hvar sáttu brúðir \hld bíta hvassara?
Sá’k-a brúðir \hld bíta ęnn bręiðara
né ęnn męira mjǫð \hld męy of drekka!”

Then quoth that Thrim, the lord of thurses: “Where sawest thou brides bite sharper? Saw I never brides bite yet broader, nor yet more mead a maiden drink.”

Sat in alsnotra \hld ambǫ́tt fyr
es orð of fann \hld við jǫtuns máli:
“Át vætr Fręyja \hld átta nóttum,
svá var hón óðfús \hld í jǫtunhęima.”

Sat the allclever maid-servant\footnotemark[1] in front, when she words did find against the speech of the ettin: “\emph{Ate} Frow nothing, for eight nights; such was she madly longing for the Ettin-homes.”
\footnotetext[1]{Lock.}

Laut und línu, \hld lysti at kyssa,
ęn hann útan stǫkk \hld ęndlangan sal:
“Hví eru ǫndótt \hld augu Fręyju?
Þykki mér ór \hld augum brenna!”

He looked beneath the linen, he lusted for a kiss, but he from the outside leapt back, across the length of the hall: “Why are the eyes of Frow fiery? Methinks there is fire coming out of the eyes!\footnotemark[1]”
\footnotetext[1]{Lit. “Methinks out of the eyes burn.”}

Sat in alsnotra \hld ambǫ́tt fyr\footnotemark[1]
es orð of fann \hld við jǫtuns máli:
“Svaf vætr Fręyja \hld átta nóttum,
svá var hón óðfús \hld í jǫtunhęima.”
\footnotetext[1]{In the ms. this word (abbreviated as \emph{f.}) is followed by \emph{ſ.}; the meaning is unclear (perhaps a word starting with ''s-'' was originally spelled out in v. 25?) and it has thus been discarded.}

Sat the allclever maid-servant in front, when she words did find against the speech of the ettin: “\emph{Slept} Frow nothing, for eight nights; such was she madly longing for the Ettin-homes.”

Inn kom in arma \hld jǫtna systir,
hin es brúðfjár \hld biðja þorði:
“Láttu þér af hǫndum \hld hringa rauða
ef þú ǫðlask vill \hld ástir mínar,
ástir mínar, \hld alla hylli!”

In came the wretched sister of the ettins, the one who for the bride-price had dared ask: “Take off from thy hands the red rings, if thou wilt win my loves; my loves, [and] all favour.”\footnotemark[1]
\footnotetext[1]{The sister, who already asked for the hammer, now has the audacity to ask “Frow” (Thunder) to take the rings off her hands and give them to her.}

Þá kvað þat Þrymr, \hld þursa dróttinn:
“Berið inn hamar \hld brúði at vígja,
leggið Mjǫllni \hld í męyjar kné,
vígið okkr saman \hld Várar hęndi!”

Then quoth that Thrim, the lord of thurses: “Bear ye in the hammer, the bride to bless; lay ye Mealen in the maiden’s knee, bless ye us two together by the hand of Ware\footnotemark[1]!”
\footnotetext[1]{A minor goddess, probably presiding over marriages.}

Hló Hlórriða \hld hugr í brjósti
es harðhugaðr \hld hamar of þękkði;
Þrym drap hann fyrstan, \hld þursa dróttin,
ok ætt jǫtuns \hld alla lamði. 

The heart of Loride laughed in his breast, when, hard-hearted, he recognized the hammer. Thrim he slew first, the lord of thurses, and all the aught† of the ettin he thrashed.

Drap hann ina ǫldnu \hld jǫtna systur,
hin es brúðfjár \hld of beðit hafði;
hón skell of hlaut \hld fyr skillinga
en hǫgg hamars \hld fyr hringa fjǫlð.

He slew the old sister of the ettins, the one who for the bride-price had asked; she received a smiting before shillings, and a strike of the hammer before a multitude of rings.

Svá kom Óðins sonr \hld ęndr at hamri. 

Thus the son of Weden returned to his hammer.
