% Introduction.
Attested in two manuscripts, \Regius\ and \AM.  The two agree very well; they share the same stanzas and they come in the same order.  The most substantial difference is the header; \AM\ has \emph{Hymis-kviða} ‘the Lay of Hymer’, while \Regius\ instead has \emph{Þórr dró Mið-garðs-orm} ‘Thunder pulled the Middenyardswyrm’.

The poem is a comedy about Thunder’s adventures in Ettinland.  This was probably a popular genre, and is also represented by \Thrymskvida, but in spite of these similarities of contents the two poems are far apart stylistically.  Whereas \Thrymskvida\ is written in a simple and sparse style with free \Fornyrdislag-meter and few kennings, the form of \Fornyrdislag\ used in \Hymiskvida\ is unusually strict, almost syllable-counting, and the stanzas are filled with intricate kennings, difficult grammatical constructions and forced word order.  In this way \Hymiskvida\ is more akin to Scoldic poetry in intricate measures like \Drottkvett\ than to typical Eddic poetry in \Fornyrdislag.

For this reason it seems likely that the anonymous poet of \Hymiskvida\ was highly trained in the Scoldic arts, and familiar with composition in more advanced meters.  (See TODO: Difference between Scoldic and Eddic).  Apart from style and meter, the Scoldic composition context of \Hymiskvida\ is also supported by both its dating and subject.  There are five extant Scoldic poetic fragments (TODO: list them) that deal with Thunder’s fishing expedition, mostly from the 10th century.

These Scoldic fragments are fragmentary, and (in what survives of them) mostly focus on the scene where Thunder faces off against the hooked Wyrm pressed to the gunwale.  There are some interesting verbal correspondences between these fragments and \Hymiskvida—most strikingly the kenning for the Middenyardswyrm in st. 22/4 below—that may also support a common composition context.  The fragments do not all agree with each other; in some of them the encounter ends with the cowardly Hymer cutting off the fishing line and the Wyrm sinking back unharmed into the sea (the version preferred by Snorre)—in others Thunder strikes the head off the Wyrm, presumably slaying it.

Numerous pictoral depictions of the myth are found on Wiking Age objects.  These are the Swedish Altuna (U 1611) and Linga (Sö 352) runestones, the picture stones from Hørdum, Northern Jutland, a picture stone from Gosforth in Cumbria, and others (TODO).  They typically show Thunder standing in the boat with His hammer raised, and the hooked Wyrm below it.  Several smaller details also appear on these objects: the use of the ox-head for bait (U 1611, Sö 352), Thunder’s feet going through the ship (U 1611, Hørdum).

\Gylfaginning\ 48 gives a complete narrative, here paraphrased for the sake of shortness:

{\small Thunder goes out into Middenyard in the shape of a young man (\emph{ungr dręngr}), without his chariot, his goats, or his typical travelling gear.  In the evening he comes to the ettin Hymer and begs for lodgings.  At dawn Hymer plans to go fishing, and so Thunder asks to join in.  Hymer insults Thunder's small stature and youth, and questions his ability to go on such a long and arduous trip as he usually takes.  Thunder, angered, says that he will row very far, and then asks Hymer what bait they will use.  Hymer tells him to get his own bait, and so he turns to Hymer’s flock of oxen and tears off the head from his greatest ox, one named Heavenrid.  The two go out to sea, and Thunder rows far past Hymer's usual fishing spot.  Hymer, unhappy, warns him that if they row any further out they'll be in danger of the Middenyardswyrm, but Thunder goes on.  Eventually Thunder puts away the oars, readies a fishing line, hooks the ox-head and lowers it.  The Wyrm soon bites, and struggles so hard that Thunder is pressed against the gunwale.  This angers the god, and he brings himself into his Os-might.  Strengthened, he pulls back with such force that his feet go through the bottom of the ship and press into the sea-floor; the Wyrm's head goes up against the gunwale.  The two archenemies furiously stare at each other, Thunder “sharpening his eyes” and the Wyrm spitting venom.  Hymer is frightened, reaches for his bait-cutting knife, and cuts off the line—the Wyrm then sinks back into the sea.  Thunder throws the hammer after it, “and men say that he struck off the monster’s head, but I think it true to tell thee, that the Middenyardswyrm still lives and lies in the outer sea.”  Thunder then punches Hymer’s ear with his fist so that he is thrown overboard head-first; the god then wades back to land.}

This account is clearly based on several sources, possibly including the present poem.  The closest wording correspondence is when it is said that \emph{Miðgarðs-ormr gein yfir uxa-hǫfuð’it, en ǫngull’inn vá í góm’inn orm’inum} ‘The Middenyardswyrm yawned over the ox-head, and the hook went into the roof of the wyrm’s mouth’, which is decently close to st. 22 below.  The name Heavenrid (\emph{Himinhrjóðr}) is otherwise only found in thules listing names of oxen, and the interesting detail of Thunder’s feet going through the boat is only paralleled by the Swedish Altuna stone (though see note to st. 34/2 below).

While \Gylfaginning\ 48, the Scoldic fragments, and \Hymiskvida\ all share the central narrative of the fishing expedition, \Hymiskvida\ has several additional narratives woven into it.  That is not to say that \Hymiskvida\ consists of multiple originally separate poems.  Unlike, say, \Havamal, which has noticable differences of style and language between its constiuent strands, \Hymiskvida\ comes off as a strong stylistic and narrative whole, composed by a single poet and thereafter transmitted faithfully.  One may roughly identify the following narrative divisions in \Hymiskvida, of which only numbers 2–4 are found in the other sources for the myth of Thunder’s fishing:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 1–6 Thunder attempts to force the ettin Eagre to host a banquet for the Gods; Eagre in turn asks for a cauldron big enough to brew enough ale for them all.
  \item 7–16 Thunder and Tew go to visit the stingy ettin Hymer, who owns such a cauldron; horrified at Thunder’s great appetite during the evening, Hymer tells them that they must eat fish the next.
  \item 17–19 Thunder says that he will go fishing if he is given bait; Hymer challenges him to kill one of his oxen for bait; Thunder tears off the head of one.
  \item 20–25 Hymer, Thunder and Tew go fishing; Hymer pulls up some whales; with the ox-head as bait Thunder manages to hook the Middenyardswyrm itself; he loses it.
  \item 26–27 Hymer challenges Thunder to carry the boat and whales back to his farm; he does.
  \item 28–32 Hymer challenges Thunder to break a supposedly indestructible chalice; he succeeds by smashing it against the ettin’s forehead.
  \item 33–36 Thunder and Tew depart with the cauldron; they find themselves followed by a troop led by Hymer; Thunder kills them all.
  \item 37–38 Lock makes the leg of one of Thunder’s goats halt.
  \item 39 Thunder returns to the Gods with Hymer’s cauldron; they host a banquet.
\end{enumerate}

The fishing expedition, found at the very center of the poem, is thus framed by the unique narrative of Thunder and Tew obtaining a huge cauldron from Hymer for the sake of brewing ale, and several other superfluous narratives scattered throughout.  The poet has not been entirely successful in his endeavour, and there are several loose strands.  Most notably the god Tew plays no role at all in the fishing expedition, probably because he was not originally in it; in other variants of the myth (including pictoral depictions, like that from Gosforth), Thunder is only accompanied by Hymer.  Tew also lacks a reaction to the murder of his father Hymer, and this familiar relationship is also unparalleled; in \Skaldskaparmal\ 16 Tew is called Weden’s Son.   Also unclear is the function of Lock’s halting one of Thunder’s goats (sts. 37–38); he does not appear anywhere else in the poem.

\sectionline

The poem has some interesting reoccurring themes.  The “otherness” of the Ettins, specifically Hymer, is constantly emphasized in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item they live far to the East (st. 5) in an inhospitable, frozen climate (st. 10), associated with mountains (sts. 2, 17) and lava-fields (st. 36)
  \item they are physically deviant, being misshapen (st. 10), grey-haired (st. 16), many-headed (sts. 8, 35), and very hard-boned (sts. 30–31); they are even likened to apes (st. 20), whales (st. 36) and Danes (st. 17; see note!),
  \item they are stingy and inhospitable (sts. 9, 16),
  \item and sarcastic and cowardly (st. 19–20, 25–26, 28–32).
\end{itemize}

In these ways the Ettins oppose the Old Germanic social norms as represented by the Gods, who live in a lush green climate and are young, beautiful and generous.  The one exception is of course Tew’s mother in st. 8, who is light-haired (in contrast to the swarthy grandmother, presumably) and generous.  Perhaps the poet is implying that it is from her that Tew has inherited his good traits?

The last point, viz. sarcasm and cowardice, is seen throughout the poem in the way Thunder comically humiliates the Ettins, especially by completing challenges issued to him.  These follow a similar format: Thunder is given a near-impossible test of strength, which he shortly completes through a mix of physical strength and cleverness, humiliating the challenger.  These tests are finding a huge kettle (st. 3, explicitly called Eagre’s “revenge” (\emph{hęfnd}), taking one of Hymer’s oxen for bait (st. 17–18), carrying home Hymer’s whales and boat (st. 26), breaking Hymer’s finest chalice (st. 28), and perhaps also taking away the kettle (st. 33)—though that may just be Hymer’s wishing to finally be rid of the pestering gods.

Much like in \Thrymskvida\ the conflict is finally resolved with righteous hammer-slaughter.  After the Gods leave, Hymer tries to get his revenge by ambushing them, but Thunder takes his trusty hammer and kills them all.  The poem is clearly humorous and meant to be performed before an audience (see st. 38 where the poet directly addresses the listeners).  The original performance context may perhaps be gleaned from the difficult final stanza. TODO: It hints at a performance at a harvest bloot.
