% Introduction.
Attested in two manuscripts, \Regius\ and \AM. The two are surprisingly consistent; all stanzas are shared, and come in the same order. The title \emph{Hymiskvida} ‘the Lay of Hymer’ comes from \AM. \Regius\ instead has, in typical red ink, the header \emph{Þórr dró Mið-garðsorm} ‘Thunder pulled the Middenyardswyrm’.

The most striking thing about this poem is its style. While the meter is \Fornyrdislag, typical for Eddic poems, it is here unusually strict, almost syllable-counting. In order to fit the strict meter, the poet uses a high amount of kennings and constructions with unusual word order, more akin to Scoldic poetry in meters like \Drottkvett than to other Eddic poetry in \Fornyrdislag (see TODO: Difference between Scoldic and Eddic). , and indicate that the poet was highly trained. I therefore find it likely.

The myth of Thunder’s fishing, likewise, is well known from a number of Skaldic poems (see TODO), with which this poem shares both kennings (e.g. 22/4 \emph{umbgjǫrð allra landa} ‘the encircler of all lands \ken*{= Middenyardswyrm}’) and wording (especially). These factors suggest that \Hymiskvida\ was composed in a Scoldic environment, perhaps even by a poet by whom we have other works preserved, although that can of course not be known.

Another notable thing about this poem is its nature as a compilation of several myths. (It must here be said, that unlike \Havamal, which has clear differences of style and language between its parts, \Hymiskvida\ is clearly a stylistic and narrative whole, composed by a single poet and then transmitted faithfully!) This is most clearly seen in its analogues. Thus, the story of Thunder’s fishing is told in \Gylfaginning\ 48, but Tew is not present, and there is no mention of a cauldron. TODO!
