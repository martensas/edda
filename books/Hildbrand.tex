% Introduction

For the text of original poem I present the manuscript text with as few textual emendations as possible. As for the orthography, I have found it impossible to produce a normalised without too heavily distorting the received text, being as it is, a blend of several dialects (one need only observe the treatment of the name Thedric, which appears thrice, and each time in a markedly different form). Apart from my typical practice of capitalising proper names, marking prefixes with ⟨·⟩ and compounds with ⟨-⟩, and using acute accents to signify long vowels, circumflex accents to signify now-monophthongised original diphthongs, and overdots to mark nasal vowels, I have done the following changes in order to clarify etymological relationships and make the text somewhat more wieldy. Of these, 8–10 have also been noted in the apparatus where they occur:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consistently replaced both \emph{ƿ} (wynn) and \emph{uu} with \emph{w}.
  \item Consistently replaced \emph{c} with \emph{k}.
  \item Consistently replaced \emph{qu} with \emph{kw}.
  \item Consistently replaced \emph{t} with \emph{t̨} in positions affected by the Second Sound Shift.
  \item Replaced \emph{th} with \emph{þ}.
  \item Replaced \emph{e} with \emph{ę} when reflecting an original a-vowel affected by \emph{i}-mutation.
  \item Replaced \emph{ó} with \emph{ǫ́} where originally an \emph{a}.
  \item Removed unetymological double \emph{nn}.
  \item Restored initial \emph{h-} where etymological and/or metrically required.
  \item Removed initial \emph{h-} unetymological and/or metrically deficient.
\end{enumerate}

The punctuation of the original, entirely consisting of interpuncts, at times representing metrical breaks, at others sporadically placed, has not been retained.

Where they appear in cæsuræ, the words \emph{kwad Hilti-brant} ‘Hildbrand quoth’ (found in ll. 30, 49, and 58) replace the usual interpunct. Due to their hypermetrical nature, I had originally planned to remove these, and instead indicate the speaker in the margins—but after comparison with various Norse stanzas (e.g. \Reginsmal\ 3, wherein the words \emph{kvað Loki} ‘Lock quoth’ appear in the stanza’s first cæsura), I have come to believe that these represent an ancient oral interjection, seemingly going back as far as the Migration Period (as it seems incredulous to think that the scribe of \HildMS\ should have influenced the four centuries younger scribe of \Regius\ in such a minor point.)

% Summary

\sectionline

The poet gives a very short formulaic introduction, from which we can tell that the beginning of the poem is preserved (1–2). Hildbrand and Hathbrand, father and son, arm and dress themselves before riding into battle, each the head of an opposing host (3–6). Hildbrand asks Hathbrand about his name and lineage, saying that he knows all noble genealogies (7–13). Hathbrand gives his name, and says that the old men of his tribe have told him that his father was Hildbrand, a brave warrior. He abandoned the newborn Hathbrand in order to serve Thedric in his fight against Edwaker, but this was a long time ago, and Hathbrand doubts that he is still alive (14–29). Realising that he is facing his son, Hildbrand invokes God as witness, and as a token of loyalty offers Hathbrand a golden bigh which the Hunnish king had given him (30–35). Hathbrand exclaims that treasures must be won by struggle alone and harshly insults his father’s manhood: he calls him an old Hun, and accuses him of having survived to old age through treachery (36–41). Hathbrand then reveals that he has learned from sailors on the Mediterranean that Hildbrand is dead (42–44).

After this follow three short speeches by Hildbrand. The second one is certainly spoken by him, but the other two may be misplaced or misattributed. Hildbrand reflects on his son’s prosperity, saying that he can tell from his clothes that he has a good lord, and that he, unlike himself, has not suffered an exile’s fate (first speech: 45–48). He then calls on God, and laments that after thirty years of war he is now forced to fight against his own son; still, he tells Hathbrand that he should easily be able to kill such an old man as himself, if he has the strength to it (second speech: 49–57). Lastly, he (or Hathbrand, if we choose to emend) says that only the most degenerate easterner would refuse the fight when his opponent so greatly desires it. He accepts his fate and declares that when the duel is over, one of the two must win and rob the corpse of the other (third speech: 58–62).

The two men then throw their javelins, each of which gets stuck in the opposing shield, before rushing into each other, hacking away at their shields until they become worthless (63–68). The rest of the poem was continued on the now-lost, following page(s).

\bvb[0]Hathbrand spoke, Hildbrand’s son: \\
“\emph{This} \emph{our} people told me— \\
the old and learned, those who lived earlier— \\
that Hildbrand was called my father—I am called Hathbrand. \\
Long ago he turned east, he fled Edwaker’s hate, \\
hence with Thedrich and his multitude of thanes. \\
He left in the land a little one to stay: \\
a bride in the bower, a bairn ungrown, \\
inheritance-less—he rode east hence, \\
at which time Thedrich was in great need \\
of my father—that was so friendless a man! \\
He was immeasurably hostile to Edwaker, \\
the dearest of thanes under Thedrich. \\
He was always at the front of the troop; him did always the fight gladden; \\
known was he among keen men; \\
I ween not that he still have life.”\evb\evg
