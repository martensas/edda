\section{Introduction}

For the text of original poem I present the manuscript text with as few textual emendations as possible. As for the orthography, I have found it impossible to produce a normalised without too heavily distorting the received text, being as it is, a blend of several dialects (one need only observe the treatment of the name Thedric, which appears thrice, and each time in a markedly different form). Apart from my typical practice of capitalising proper names, marking prefixes with ⟨·⟩ and compounds with ⟨-⟩, and using acute accents to signify long vowels, circumflex accents to signify now-monophthongised original diphthongs, and overdots to mark nasal vowels, I have done the following changes in order to clarify etymological relationships and make the text somewhat more wieldy. Of these, 8–10 have also been noted in the apparatus where they occur:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consistently replaced both \emph{ƿ} (wynn) and \emph{uu} with \emph{w}.
  \item Consistently replaced \emph{c} with \emph{k}.
  \item Consistently replaced \emph{qu} with \emph{kw}.
  \item Consistently replaced \emph{t} with \emph{t̨} in positions affected by the Second Sound Shift.
  \item Replaced \emph{th} with \emph{þ}.
  \item Replaced \emph{e} with \emph{ę} when reflecting an original a-vowel affected by \emph{i}-mutation.
  \item Replaced \emph{ó} with \emph{ǫ́} where originally an \emph{a}.
  \item Removed unetymological double \emph{nn}.
  \item Restored initial \emph{h-} where etymological and/or metrically required.
  \item Removed initial \emph{h-} unetymological and/or metrically deficient.
\end{enumerate}

The punctuation of the original, entirely consisting of interpuncts, at times representing metrical breaks, at others sporadically placed, has not been retained.

Where they appear in cæsuræ, the words \emph{kwad Hilti-brant} ‘Hildbrand quoth’ (found in ll. 30, 49, and 58) replace the usual interpunct. Due to their hypermetrical nature, I had originally planned to remove these, and instead indicate the speaker in the margins—but after comparison with various Norse stanzas (e.g. \Reginsmal\ 3, wherein the words \emph{kvað Loki} ‘Lock quoth’ appear in the stanza’s first cæsura), I have come to believe that these represent an ancient oral interjection, seemingly going back as far as the Migration Period (as it seems incredulous to think that the scribe of \HildMS\ should have influenced the four centuries younger scribe of \Regius\ in such a minor point.)

\subsection{Summary}

The poet begins with a short formulaic introduction; he is relating older stories (1–2).  The two duellists, Hildbrand and Hathbrand, father and son, arm themselves and ride into battle at the head of two opposing armies (3–6). They speak, and Hildbrand asks Hathbrand for his name and lineage (7–13). Hathbrand gives his name and ancestry; his father was the warrior Hildbrand, who abandoned him as a newborn. This was long ago, and Hathbrand does not think him still alive (14–29). Hearing this, Hildbrand calls on God as witness, and offers his son a golden torc as a token of loyalty (30–34). Hathbrand takes this as an insulting tricks. He proclaims that wealth should be won by struggle alone and accuses Hildbrand of having grown old through treachery (35–40); he has heard from sailors on the Mediterranean that his father is dead (41–43).

After this straight-forward narrative sequence three short speeches follow, in the ms. all spoken by Hildbrand. The second is certainly spoken by Hildbrand, but the other two may be misplaced or misattributed.

1. Hildbrand reflects on his son’s prosperity: from his clothes he can tell that he has a good lord, and that he, unlike himself, has not suffered the fate of exile (44–47).

2. Hildbrand calls on God, and laments that, after thirty years at war, he is now forced to fight against his own son. Still, Hathbrand should easily be able to kill such an old man as Hildbrand, if he has strength and fate on his side (48–56).

3. Hildbrand (or Hathbrand, and there is a case for emending here) says that only the most cowardly easterner could refuse the fight so greatly desired. Let both men fight their hardest, and when the duel is over the winner will strip the armour of the other (57–61).

The two men then throw their javelins into each other’s shield and rush at each other, hacking away at their shields until they become worthless (62–67). Here the poem abruptly ends.

\bvb[0]Hathbrand spoke, Hildbrand’s son: \\
“This our liegemen have said to me— \\
the old and learned, they who earlier lived: \\
that Hildbrand was my father called—I am called Hathbrand. \\
Of yore he turned east; he fled Edwaker’s hate, \\
away with Thedric and his multitude of thanes. \\
He left in the land a little one to stay; \\
a bride in the bower, a bairn ungrown, \\
heritance-less. He rode away to the east, \\
at the time when Thedric was in great need \\
of my father—that was so friendless a man! \\
He was toward Edwaker utterly hostile; \\
the dearest of thanes under Thedric. \\
He was always in the front of the troop; him did always the fighting gladden; \\
known was he among keen men.— \\
I guess not that he still live.”\evb\evg
