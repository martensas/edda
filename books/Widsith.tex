\bvb Widsith spoke, unlocked his word-hoard, \\
he who through the most tribes on earth \\
and nations had journeyed. Often on the bench he received \\
delightful treasures. From the Mirgings \\
his ancestry stemmed. Together with Elhild, \\
the good peace-weaveress, for the first time \\
he had sought out the Reth-King’s realm, \\
east of the Angles, [the realm of] \inx[P]{Erminric}, \\
the fierce oath-breaker.  He then began a long speech:\evb\evg
