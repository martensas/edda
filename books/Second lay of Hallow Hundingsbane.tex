Helgi fekk Sigrúnar ok áttu þau sonu; var Helgi eigi gamall. Dagr Hǫgna sonr blótaði Óðin til fǫðurhefnda. Óðinn léði Dag geirs síns. Dagr fann Helga, mág sinn, þar sem heitir at Fjǫturlundi. Hann lagði í gǫgnum Helga með geirnum. Þar fell Helgi en Dagr reið til fjalla ok sagði Sigrúnu tíðindi: 

Hallow got Sighrun, and they owned sons; Hallow was not old. Day, son of Hain, blooted† to Weden to gain revenge for his father. Weden lent his spear to Day. Day found Hallow, his brother-in-law, on the place called Fetterlund. He pierced Hallow with the spear. There Hallow fell, but Day rode to the mountains and told Sighrun the news:

“Trauðr em ek, systir, \hld trega þér at sęgja
þvíat ek hęfi nauðigr \hld nipti grætta:
Fell í morgun \hld und Fjǫturlundi
buðlungr sá es vas \hld bęztr í hęimi
ok hildingum \hld á hálsi stóð.”

“Regretful am I, sister, to pain thee by saying — for I have been forced to cause my kinswoman to cry: This morning fell 'neath Fetterlund, the prince who was the best in the world, and on the necks of rulers stood.”
