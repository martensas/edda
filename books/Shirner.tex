\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Speeches of Shirner} (\Skirnismal) are attested in full in both \Regius\ and \AM.  The name \emph{Skírnismǫ́l} ‘Speeches of Shirner’ comes from \AM; \Regius\ instead has \emph{Fǫr Skírnis} ‘Shirner’s journey’.

\subsection{Parallel in Gylfaginning}

The same narrative is found in \Gylfaginning\ 37, which also quotes stanza 42 of the present poem.  That account begins with a long introduction, corresponding to P1–2:

\begin{quote}‘Gymer was a man called, and his woman Earbode; she was of the lineage of mountain-risers. Their daughter is Gird, who is fairest of all women.  It was one day when Free had gone to Lithshelf and looked about all the Homes.  And when he looked north he saw on a farm a great and fine house, and to that house walked a woman, and when she lifted her hands and closed the doors behind her it shone from her hands into both the air and onto the waters, and all the homes were brightened by her.  And that beauty which he had seen in that holy seat harmed him so greatly that he walked away filled with grief, and when he came home he spoke nothing; he neither slept nor drank.  No one dared to get words out of him.’\end{quote}

After this it paraphrases sts. 3–9, describing Shirner’s interaction with Free:

\begin{quote}‘Then Nearth had Shirner, Free’s shoe-swain, called unto him, and asked him to go to Free and bid him to speak and ask at whom he was so wroth that he would not speak with men.  And Shirner said that he would go, although not eagerly, and said that he expected ill answers from him.

And when he came to Free he asked why Free were so downcast and spoke nothing with men.  Then Free answers, and said that he had seen a fair woman and for her sakes was he so full of grief that he would not live long if he should not reach her, “and now shalt thou journey to ask for her hand for me, and have her home hither whether her father wants to or not, and I shall reward thee well for that.”

Then Shirner answers; said so, that he will go on the errand-journey, but Free shall give him his sword; it was such a good sword that it struck by itself.  And Free did not refuse that and gave him the sword.’\end{quote}

The rest of the poem (sts. 10–38) is summarised very succinctly:

\begin{quote}‘Then Shirner journeyed and asked for the woman’s [Gird’s] hand for him [Free], and got her promise that nine nights later she would come to that place which is called Barrey and have a wedding with Free.  And when Shirner told Free his errand, then he quoth this:’\end{quote}

After which the author quotes a variant of stanza 42, with some minor differences in wording that seem to stem from oral tradition (see Note to that st.)  He last explains that \emph{Þessi sǫk er til þess, er Freyr var svá vápn-lauss, er hann barðist við Belja ok drap hann með hjartar-horni.} ‘This event is the reason why Free was so weaponless when he fought against \inx[P]{Bellower} and slew him with a hart’s antler.’

It seems near-certain that the author of \Gylfaginning\ had access to \Skirnismal\ directly rather than a mere retelling of the story.  There is no detail in his paraphrase that is not found in the present version of the poem, although the introductory prose differs a fair bit, and Shirner’s curse is entirely omitted.  This is easily explained if he his version of \Skirnismal\ was written down from a slightly different oral tradition; the poetry, being in bound form, would be much more stable than the more fluid introductory prose.  To sum up a narrative mythic poem in prose form and then quote one or two stanzas is something probably done elsewhere in \Gylfaginning; see the Eddic fragments from Snorre’s Edda below.

Freyr, sonr Njarðar, hafði einn dag setsk í Hlið-skjálf ok sá um heima alla; hann sá í Jǫtun-heima ok sá þar mey fagra, þá er hon gekk frá skála fǫður síns til skemmu; þar af fekk hann hug-sóttir miklar. Skírnir hét skó-sveinn Freys. Njǫrðr bað hann kveðja Frey máls. Þá mę́lti Skaði:\epa

\bpb \inx[P]{Free}, son of \inx[P]{Nearth}, had one day set himself in \inx[L]{Lithshelf} and looked about all the \inx[C]{Homes}.  He looked into the \inx[L]{Ettinhomes} and saw there a fair maiden as she walked from her father’s hall to her bower; thereof he got great heart-aches.  \inx[P]{Shirner} was called the shoe-swain of Free.  Nearth asked him to speak with Free.  Then \inx[P]{Shede} spoke:\epb\epg

In the present stanza it answers Free’s addressing Shirner as \emph{sęggr hinn ungi} ‘the young youth’; Shirner points out that the two are of equal age, and so Free is as much of a young man as he.}} né \alst{s}ęgir; &
