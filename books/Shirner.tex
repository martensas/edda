% Introduction

The whole poem is attested in both \Regius\ and \AM. The name \emph{Skírnismǫ́l} ‘\textbf{Speeches of Shirner}’ comes from \AM; \Regius\ has the header \emph{Fǫr Skírnis} ‘Shirner’s journey’.

The same myth is told in \Gylfaginning\ 37. A single verse of the present poem is quoted there, namely the last one (42), with some minor differences in wording that would seem to stem from oral tradition (see Note there). One could speculate that the author of \Gylfaginning\ did not have a copy of this poem in front of him, but rather knew of the story through an oral tradition which included only the last verse. This seems unlikely for the chief reason that this paraphrase does not add a single detail not already in the present poem, but on the other hand condenses and abbreviates that which is already written here. Thus Shirner’s journey and curse (roughly vv. 10–38 here) is simply summarized in the following manner: “Then Shirner journeyed and requested the woman [i.e. Gird] for him [i.e. Free], and received her promise, that nine nights later she would come to the place which is called Barrey, and have a wedding with Free.”

On the other hand, the paragraph in \Gylfaginning\ 37 that corresponds to what is here P1 is much more detailed. It goes: “Gymer was a man called, and his woman Earbode; she was of the lineage of mountain-risers. Their daughter is Gird, who is fairest of all women. It was one day as Free had gone to Lithshelf and looked about all the Homes. And when he looked to the north he saw on a farm a large and fair house, and into that house walked a woman. And when she brought out her hands and closed the doors before her, then light shone off her hands—both into the air and onto the waters—and all the homes were brightened by her. That beauty, when he had set himself in that holy seat, harmed him so that he walked away filled with pain. And when he came home he spoke nothing. Nothing slept he, nothing drank he. Nobody dared to ask him to speak. Then Nearth had Shirner, Free’s shoe-swain, called unto him, and asked him to go to Free and ask him to speak, [...]”

It seems to me that this circumstance, where the part corresponding to the poem is a short paraphrase, but the part corresponding to the prose passage is much more detailed, can only have arisen if the former already had a fixed form, whereas the latter was freer and could vary with each retelling. For this, see further TODO.

This sense is also seen in \Volundarkvida\ 23, where it is used in reference to king Nithad’s two young sons.
