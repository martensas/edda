Without it, the whole world would burn up.} \ken{sun}—[also] on the ear of Yorewaker, on the hoof of Allswith, on that wheel which turns beneath the chariot of Rungner, on the teeth of Slopner, and on the fetters of sleds, on the paw of the bear, and on the tongue of Bray, on the claws of the wolf, and on the beak of the eagle, on bloody wings, and on the supports of the bridge, on the palm of release, and the track of grace, on glass and on gold, and on the good healths of men, in wine and beerwort, and on the comfortable seat.\evb
