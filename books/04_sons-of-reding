\book{From the Sons of king Reding. (Frá sonum Hrauðungs konungs)}\bookStart

\bva Hrauðungr konungr átti tvá sonu. Hét annarr Agnarr, enn annarr Geirrøðr.
\bva Agnarr var tíu vetra enn Geirrøðr átta vetra. Þeir reru tveir á báti með dorgar sínar at smáfiski.
\bva Vindr rak þá í haf út. Í náttmyrkri brutu þeir við land ok gingu upp; fundu kotbónda einn.
\bva Þar vǫ́ru þeir um vetrinn. Kerling fostraði Agnar enn karl Geirrøð.
\bva At vári fekk karl þeim skip. Enn er þau kerling leiddu þá til strandar, þá mælti karl einmæli við Geirrøð.
\bva Þeir fengu byr ok kvǫ́mu til stǫðva fǫður síns. Geirrøðr var fram í skipi.
\bva Hann hljóp upp á land enn hratt út skipinu, ok mælti: ”Far þú þar er smyl hafi þik.”
\bva Skipit rak út. Enn Geirrøðr gekk út til bǿjar; hánum var vel fagnat;
\bva þá var faðir hans andaðr. Var þá Geirrøðr til konungs tekinn, ok varð maðr ágætr.

\bvb King Reding owned two sons. One was called Eynhere, and the other Garred.
\bvb Eynhere was ten winters old, and Garred eight winters. The two were rowing in a boat with their trolling-lines for small fishing.
\bvb Wind then drove them out into the sea. In the darkness of night they crashed into land and walked up; they found a lone cottage-farmer.
\bvb There they were about the winter. The wife fostered Eynhere, but the husband Garred.
\bvb At spring the man got them ships. But when the woman led them to the shore, the husband spoke privately with Garred.
\bvb They got favourable wind, and came to their father's harbour. Garred was in the front of the ship.
\bvb He leapt up onto land and pushed out the ship, and spoke: ”Go thou where the \textbf{smil} might have thee.”
\bvb The ship drove out. But Garred walked towards the farm; he was welcomed well;
\bvb his father had by then drawn his final breath. Then was Garred taken as king, and became an excellent man.

\bva Óðinn ok Frigg sátu í Hliðskjǫlfu ok sá um heima alla.
\bva Óðinn mælti: Sér þú Agnar fóstra þinn, hvar hann elr bǫrn við gýgi í hellinum? 
\bva En Geirrøðr, fóstri minn, er konungr ok sitr nú at landi.
\bva Frigg segir: Hann er matníðingr sá at hann kvelr gesti sína ef hánum þykkja ofmargir koma.
\bva Óðinn segir at þat er in mesta lygi. Þau veðja um þetta mál.
\bva Frigg sendi eskismey sína, Fullu, til Geirrøðar. Hon bað konung varask at eigi fyrgerði hánum fjǫlkunnigr maðr sá er þar var kominn í land ok sagði þat mark á at engi hundr var svá olmr at á hann myndi hlaupa.
\bva En þat var inn mesti hégómi at Geirrøðr væri eigi matgóðr ok þó lætr hann handtaka þann mann er eigi vildu hundar á ráða.
\bva Sá var í feldi blám ok nefndisk Grímnir ok sagði ekki fleira frá sér þótt hann væri atspurðr.
\bva Konungr lét hann pína til sagna ok setja milli elda tveggja ok sat hann þar átta nætr.
\bva Geirrøðr konungr átti son tíu vetra gamlan ok hét Agnarr eftir bróður hans.
\bva Agnarr gekk at Grímni ok gaf hánum horn fullt at drekka, sagði að konungr gerði illa er hann lét pína hann saklausan.
\bva Grímnir drakk af. Þá var eldrinn svá kominn at feldrinn brann af Grímni. Hann kvað: 

\bvb Weden and Frie sat in Litheshelf and looked about all the Homes.
\bvb Weden spoke: Seest thou Eynhere thy foster-son, where he begets children with the troll-woman in the cave?
\bvb But Garred, my foster-son, is king and now sits at land.
\bvb Frie says: He is such a meat-nithing that he tortures his guests if he thinks there are too many of them.
\bvb Weden says that this is the greatest lie; they make a bet about this matter.
\bvb Frie sent her handmaid Full to Garred's. She asked the king to be wary, that he might not be ended by that fealcunning man who was come in the land, and said that his mark was that no hound were so fierce that he would leap onto him.
\bvb But that was the greatest vainglory that Garred would not be meat-good, and yet he has that man seized, whom the dogs would not touch.
\bvb He was clad in a blue cloak, and called himself Grimen, and did not tell any more about himself, even though he was interrogated.
\bvb The king had him tortured so that he would speak, and set him between two fires, and he remained there for eight nights.
\bvb King Garred had a son ten winters old, and he was named Eynhere after his brother.
\bvb Eynhere walked up to Grimen, and gave him a full horn to drink, saying that the king did ill as he had him tortured without cause.
\bvb Grimen drank from it; then the fire had come such that the cloak burned on Grimen. He quoth:
