After Siward’s death Guthrun is so upset that she cannot make herself weep.

\section{From the Death of Siward (\emph{Frá dauða Sigurðar})}

\bpg\bpa Hér er sagt í þessi kviðu frá dauða Sigurðar ok víkr hér svá til sem þeir drę́pi hann úti. En sumir segja svá at þeir drę́pi hann inni í rekkju sinni sofanda. En þýðverskir menn segja svá at þeir drę́pi hann úti í skógi ok svá segir í Guðrúnar kviðu inni fornu at Sigurðr ok Gjúka synir hefði til þings riðit þá er hann var drepinn—en þat segja allir einnig at þeir sviku hann í tryggð ok vógu at hánum liggjanda ok ó·búnum.
Guðrún sat yfir Sigurði dauðum. Hon grét eigi sem aðrar konur en hon var búin til at springa af harmi. Til gengu bę́ði konur ok karlar at hugga hana en þat var eigi auð-velt. Þat er sǫgn manna at Guðrún hefði etit af Fáfnis hjarta ok hon skilði því fugls rǫdd. Þetta er enn kveðit um Guðrúnu:\epa

\bpb Here it is said in this lay about the death of Siward, and it is at this point that they slew him outside. But some say that they slew him inside in his chamber asleep. But German men say that they slew him outside in the forest, and so it says in the Ancientr Lay of Guthrun that Siward and the sons of Yivick had ridden to the Thing when he was slain—but this they all say in agreement that they betrayed him while he trusted them, and struck at him lying and unarmed.
Guthrun sat over Siward, dead. She did not weep like other women, but she was ready to burst apart from sorrow. Both women and men came to her to console her, but that was not easily done. It is the saying of men that Guthrun had eaten of Fathomer’s heart, and she therefore understood the speech of birds. This is further said about Guthrun:\epb\epg

Ár vas þat’s \alst{G}uðrún \hld\ \alst{g}ørðisk at dęyja, &
es hǫ́n \alst{s}at \alst{s}org-full \hld\ yfir \alst{S}igurði, &
gørði-t hǫ́n \alst{h}júfra \hld\ né \alst{h}ǫndum sláa &
né \alst{k}vęina of \hld\ sem \alst{k}onur aðrar.\eva

\bvb It was of yore that Guthrun made ready to die \\
as she sat sorrowful over Siward. \\
She did not pant nor beat her hands \\
nor wail over him like other women.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Gingu \alst{ja}rlar \hld\ \alst{a}l-snotrir framm, &
þęir’s \alst{h}arðs \alst{h}ugar \hld\ \alst{h}ana lǫttu; &
þęygi \alst{G}uðrún \hld\ \alst{g}ráta mátti, &
svá vas hǫ́n \alst{m}óðug; \hld\ \alst{m}undi hǫ́n springa.\eva

\bvb There came earls all-clever forth, \\
they who would loosen her hard heart. \\
Yet nowise could Guthrun weep, \\
so moody was she—she would burst apart.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Sǫ́tu \alst{í}trar \hld\ \alst{ja}rla brúðir &
\alst{g}olli búnar \hld\ fyr \alst{G}uðrúnu; &
hvęr \alst{s}agði þęira \hld\ \alst{s}ínn of-trega &
þann’s \alst{b}itrastan \hld\ of \alst{b}eðit hafði.\eva

\bvb There sat the splendid brides of the earls \\
adorned with gold before Guthrun. \\
Each one of them told her own great sorrow, \\
the bitterest one that she had suffered.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þȧ kvað \alst{G}jaflaug, \hld\ \alst{G}júka systir: &
„\alst{M}ik vęit’k á \alst{m}oldu \hld\ \alst{m}unar-lausasta; &
hęfi’k \alst{f}imm vera \hld\ \alst{f}or-spell beðit, &
tvęggja dǿtra, \hld\ þriggja systra, &
\alst{á}tta brǿðra, \hld\ þó ek \alst{ęi}n lifi.“\eva

\bvb Then quoth Yeflie, Yivick’s sister: \\
“I know myself on the earth to be the most joyless. \\
Of five husbands have I suffered the loss, \\
of two daughters, three sisters, \\
eight brothers—yet I alone live.”\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þęygi \alst{G}uðrún \hld\ \alst{g}ráta mátti; &
svá vas hǫ́n \alst{m}óðug \hld\ at \alst{m}ǫg dauðan &
ok \alst{h}arð-\alst{h}uguð \hld\ of \alst{h}rør fylkis.\eva

\bvb Yet nowise could Guthrun weep; \\
so moody was she after the lad’s death, \\
and hard-hearted over the marshal’s corpse.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þȧ kvað þat \alst{H}ęrborg, \hld\ \alst{H}úna-lands dróttning: &
„\alst{H}ęfi’k \alst{h}arðara \hld\ \alst{h}arm at sęgja: &
mínir \alst{s}jau \alst{s}ynir \hld\ \alst{s}unnan lands, &
\alst{v}err inn átti, \hld\ ï \alst{v}al fellu.\eva

\bvb Then quoth this Harburg, Hunland’s queen: \\
“I have a harder harm to tell. \\
My seven sons to the south of their land, \\
—my husband eighth—in battle fell.”\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
\alst{F}aðir ok móðir, \hld\ \alst{f}jórir brǿðr, &
þau ȧ \alst{v}ági \hld\ \alst{v}indr of lék, &
\alst{b}arði \alst{b}ára \hld\ við \alst{b}orð-þili.\eva

\bvb My father and mother, four brothers— \\
them on the wave the wind outplayed; \\
the breaker beat against the ship-side.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Sjǫlf skylda’k \alst{g}ǫfga, \hld\ sjǫlf skylda’k \alst{g}ǫtva, &
sjǫlf skylda’k \alst{h}ǫndla, \hld\ \edtext{\alst{h}ęl-fǫr}{\Afootnote{emend.; \emph{hęr-fǫr} \Regius}} þęira; &

svá’t \alst{m}ér \alst{m}aðr ęngi \hld\ \alst{m}unar lęitaði.\eva

\bvb I alone had to honour them; I alone had to bury them; \\
I alone had to handle their hell-journey \ken{death}. \\
This all I suffered in one half-year, \\
while noone found me any joy.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þȧ varð’k \alst{h}apta \hld\ ok \alst{h}ęr-numa &
\alst{s}ams misseris \hld\ \alst{s}íðan-verða; &
\alst{sk}ylda’k \alst{sk}ręyta \hld\ ok \alst{sk}úa binda &
\alst{h}ęrsis kván \hld\ \alst{h}vęrjan morgin.\eva

\bvb Then I became a captive and taken in war, \\
in the latter part of that same half-year. \\
I had to dress and bind the shoes \\
of the ruler’s wife every morning.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Hǫ́n \alst{ǿ}gði mér \hld\ af \alst{a}f-brýði &
ok \alst{h}ǫrðum mik \hld\ \alst{h}ǫggum kęyrði; &
fann’k \alst{h}ús-guma \hld\ \alst{h}vęrgi inn bętra &
en \alst{h}ús-fręyju \hld\ \alst{h}vęrgi verri.“\eva

\bvb She tortured me out of jealousy \\
and with hard blows drove me on. \\
A husband nowhere I’ve met better, \\
but a housewife nowhere worse.”\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þęygi \alst{G}uðrún \hld\ \alst{g}ráta mátti; &
svá vas hǫ́n \alst{m}óðug \hld\ at \alst{m}ǫg dauðan &
ok \alst{h}arð-\alst{h}uguð \hld\ of \alst{h}rør fylkis.\eva

\bvb Yet nowise could Guthrun weep; \\
so moody was she after the lad’s death, \\
and hard-hearted over the marshal’s corpse.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þȧ kvað þat \alst{G}ullrǫnd, \hld\ \alst{G}júka dóttir: &
„\alst{F}ǫ́ kannt, \alst{f}óstra, \hld\ þótt \alst{f}róð séir, &
\alst{u}ngu vífi \hld\ \alst{a}nd-spjǫll bera.“ &
Varaði hǫ́n at \alst{h}ylja \hld\ of \alst{h}rør fylkis.\eva

\bvb Then quoth this Goldrand, Yivick’s daughter: \\
“Little canst thou, foster-mother—though thou be wise— \\
to a young wife give answers.”— \\
She bade them uncover the marshal’s corpse.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
\alst{S}vipti hǫ́n blę́ju \hld\ af \alst{S}igurði &
ok \alst{v}att \alst{v}ęngi \hld\ fyr \alst{v}ífs knjám: &
„\alst{L}ít-tu ȧ \alst{l}júfan, \hld\ \alst{l}ęgg þú munn við grǫn &
sem þú \alst{h}alsaðir \hld\ \alst{h}ęilan stilli.“\eva

\bvb She cast the shroud off of Siward \\
and turned his cheeks before the knees of the wife: \\
“Look on the beloved! Lay your mouth to his lips \\
like thou didst embrace the hale prince.”\evb\evg


\bvg\bva\alst{Ȧ} lęit Guðrún \hld\ \alst{ęi}nu sinni; &
sá hǫ́n \alst{d}ǫglings skǫr \hld\ \alst{d}ręyra runna, &
\alst{f}ránar sjónir \hld\ \alst{f}ylkis liðnar, &
\alst{h}ug-borg jǫfurs \hld\ \alst{h}jǫrvi skorna.\eva

\bvb On him looked Guthrun a single time; \\
she saw the noble’s locks run with blood, \\
the gleaming gaze of the marshal gone, \\
the heart-fort \ken{chest} of the ruler cut by the sword.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þȧ \alst{h}né Guðrún \hld\ \alst{h}ǫll við bólstri; &
\alst{h}addr losnaði, \hld\ \alst{h}lýr roðnaði &
en \alst{r}egns dropi \hld\ \alst{r}ann niðr umb kné.\eva

\bvb Then Guthrun sank down, slooped against the bolster; \\
her hair loosened, her cheek reddened, \\
and a droplet of rain ran down to her knee.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þȧ \alst{g}rét \alst{G}uðrún, \hld\ \alst{G}júka dóttir, &

\bvb Then wept Guthrun, Yivick’s daughter, \\
so that the tears flew through her veil(?) \\
and in response shrieked the geese in the yard, \\
the famèd fowls which the maiden owned.\evb\evg


\bvg\bva%
Þȧ kvað þat \alst{G}ullrǫnd, \hld\ \alst{G}júka dóttir: &
„\alst{y}kkar vissa’k \hld\ \alst{ȧ}stir męstar &

\bvb Then quoth this Goldrand, Yivick’s daughter: \\
“I knew the love of you two to be the greatest \\
of all men above the earth. \\
Thou wast never content outside or inside, \\
O sister of mine, save by Siward’s side.”\evb\evg

“So was my Siward beside the sons of Yivick \\

\bvb I also seemed to the ruler’s champions \\

\bvb I miss in the seat and in the bed \\

the lads of Yivick are at fault for my bale, \\

\bvb So may ye make the land deserted by folk \\
like ye have treated the sworn oaths! \\
Thou wilt not, Guther, enjoy the gold; \\
those bighs will for thee become the bane, \\
on which thou to Siward didst swear the oaths.\evb\evg

Guðrún gekk þaðan á braut til skógar á eyði-merkr ok fór allt til Danmarkar ok var þar með Þóru, Hákonar dóttur, sjau misseri. Brynhildr vildi eigi lifa eptir Sigurð. Hon lét drepa þrę́la sína átta ok fimm ambóttir, þá lagði hon sik sverði til bana svá sem segir í Sigurðar kviðu inni skǫmmu.\epa

\bpb Guthrun then went away to the woods in the wilderness and journeyed all the way to Denmark and stayed there with Thure, Hathkin’s daughter, for seven half-years. Byrnhild did not want to live after Siward. She had her eight thralls and five handmaids slain, then she ran herself through with a sword unto her death, as it says in the Short Lay of Siward.\epb\epg
