% Introduction.
Attested in two manuscripts, \Regius\ and \AM. The two are surprisingly consistent.

Thunder pulled the Middenyardsworm.\footnotetext{This is the only title the poem has in \Regius. \AM\ has the proper title \emph{Hymiskviða} instead.}

\bva Ár valtívar \hld vęiðar nǫ́mu &
ok sumblsamir \hld áðr saðir yrði, &
hristu tęina \hld ok á hlaut sǫ́u, &
fundu þęir at Ægis \hld ørkost hvera.\eva

\bvb Of yore the slaughter-Tues had caught game\footnoteB{Lit. ‘took game’}, and banqueting before they might eat\footnoteB{Lit. ‘might become sated’}, they shook the twigs and looked at the \inx{leat}; they found at Eyer’s a great choice of cauldrons.\footnoteB{The gods sprinkled the leat (sacrificial blood) of the beasts and interpreted the pattern; they found it most auspicious to feast at Eyer’s.}\evb

\bva Sat bergbúi \hld barntęitr fyr, &
mjǫk glíkr męgi \hld Miskorblinda, &
lęit í augu \hld Yggs barn í þrá: &
“þú skalt ǫ́sum \hld opt sumbl \edtext{gęra}{\lemma{gęra “host”}\Afootnote{gefa “give” \AM}}!”\eva

\bvb — Sat the mountain-dweller \ken{Eyer}[1] there, joyous like a child, much like the lad of Misherblind\footnoteB{A reference to a lost myth? Unless Misherblind is an alternative name for Firneet, Eyer’s father.}; into his eyes looked the child of Ug <= Weden> \ken{Thunder}[1] in defiance: “Thou shalt for the Ease oft’ host banquets!”\footnoteB{Having seen that Eyer has a great store of cauldrons, Thunder orders him to host future banquets for the Ease.}\evb

\bva Ǫnn fekk jǫtni \hld orðbæginn halr, &
hugði at hefndum \hld hann næst við goð, &
bað hann Sifjar ver \hld sér fǿra hver, &
“þann’s ek ǫllum ǫl \hld yðr of hęita”.\eva

\bvb Great toil for the ettin the word-peevish man \ken{Thunder}[1] caused; thought he of revenge, soon, against the god: asked he Sib’s husband to bring him a cauldron, “that one with which I for you all ale might brew.”\footnoteB{Eyer asks Thunder to find a single cauldron which can hold enough ale to supply all the Ease.}

\bva Né þat mǫ́ttu \hld mærir tívar &
ok ginnręgin \hld of geta hvęrgi, &
unz af tryggðum \hld Týr Hlórriða &
ástráð mikit \hld ęinum sagði:\eva

\bvb But that might the renowned Tues and the \inx{Gin-Reins} nowhere get ahold of, until out of loyalty, a great word of loving advice Tue to Loride <= Thunder> alone did say:\evb

\bva “Býr fyr austan \hld Élivága &
hundvíss Hymir \hld at himins ęnda, &
á minn faðir \hld móðugr kętil, &
\edtext{rúmbrugðinn}{\Afootnote{‘rumbrygðan’ \AM}} hver \hld rastar djúpan.”\eva

\bvb “Lives to the east of the Ilewaves the houndwise Hymer, at the end of heaven. Owns my father\footnoteB{Hymer being Tue’s father.}, fierce, a kettle; a size-renowned cauldron one \inx{rest} deep.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva “Veiztu, ef þiggjum \hld þann lǫgvelli?” &
“Ef, vinr, vélar \hld vit gørvum til!”\eva

\bvb “Knowest thou if we will receive that ale-boiler?” — “If, friend, we two make use of wiles!”\footnoteB{The speakers are not indicated, but it is most sensible that Thunder asks and Tue answers.}\evb

Hirði hann hafra \hld horngǫfgasta; &
hurfu at hǫllu \hld es Hymir átti.\eva

\bvb — They travelled with great strides from the beginning of the day, from Osyard, until to Agle’s they came—he herded bucks with the noblest of horns—they turned to the hall which Hymer owned.\evb

\bva Mǫgr fann ǫmmu, \hld mjǫk lęiða sér, &
hafði hǫfða \hld hundruð níu. &
ęn ǫnnur gekk \hld algollin framm &
brúnhvít bera \hld bjórvęig syni.\eva

\bvb The lad found his grandmother greatly loathsome; she had of heads nine hundred. But another woman, all-golden, stepped forth: white-browed, she carried a beer-draught for her son \ken{Tue}[1].\evb

\bva Áttniðr jǫtna \hld ek vilja’k ykr &

gløggr við gęsti \hld gǫrr ills hugar.\eva

\bvb “Kinsman of ettins! I would wish to set you two high-mettled men under the cauldrons; many a time my lover has been stingy against guests, quick to ill temper.”\footnoteB{Tue’s mother wishes to hide him and Thunder under the cauldron, lest her husband (Hyme) find them.}\evb
