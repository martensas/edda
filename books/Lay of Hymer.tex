\bookStart{The Lay of Hymer}[Hymiskviða]

% Introduction.
Attested in two manuscripts, \Regius\ and \AM. The two are surprisingly consistent.

Þórr dró Miðgarðsorm. % TODO: Format as header.

Thunder pulled up the Middenyardsworm.\footnotetext{This is the only title the poem has in \Regius. \AM\ has the proper title \emph{Hymiskviða} instead.}

\bva Ár valtívar \hld\ vęiðar nǫ́mu &
ok sumblsamir \hld\ áðr saðir yrði, &
hristu tęina \hld\ ok á hlaut sǫ́u, &
fundu þęir at Ę́gis \hld\ ørkost hvera.\eva

\bvb Of yore the slaughter-Tues had caught game\footnoteB{Lit. ‘took game’}, and banqueting before they might eat\footnoteB{Lit. ‘might become sated’}, they shook the twigs and looked at the \inx{leat}; they found at Eagre’s a great choice of cauldrons.\footnoteB{The gods sprinkled the leat (sacrificial blood) of the beasts and interpreted the pattern; they found it most auspicious to feast at Eagre’s.}\evb

\bva Sat bergbúi \hld\ barntęitr fyrir, &
mjǫk glíkr męgi \hld\ Miskorblinda, &
lęit í augu \hld\ Yggs barn í þrá: &
„þú skalt ǫ́sum \hld\ opt sumbl \edtext{gęra}{\lemma{gęra “host”}\Afootnote{gefa “give” \AM}}!“\eva

\bvb — Sat the mountain-dweller \ken*{= Eagre} there, joyous like a child, much like the lad of Misherblind\footnoteB{A reference to a lost myth? Unless Misherblind is an alternative name for Firneet, Eagre’s father.}; into his eyes looked the child of Ug \name{= Weden} \ken*{= Thunder} in defiance: “Thou shalt for the Ease oft’ host banquets!”\footnoteB{Having seen that Eagre has a great store of cauldrons, Thunder orders him to host future banquets for the Ease.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ǫnn fekk jǫtni \hld\ orðbę́ginn halr, &
hugði at hefndum \hld\ hann nę́st við goð, &
bað hann Sifjar ver \hld\ sér fǿra hver, &
„þann’s ek ǫllum ǫl \hld\ yðr of hęita.“\eva

\bvb Great toil for the ettin the word-peevish man \ken*{= Thunder} caused; thought he of revenge, soon, against the god: asked he Sib’s husband to bring him a cauldron, “that one with which I for you all ale might brew.\footnoteB{Eagre asks Thunder to find a single cauldron which can hold enough ale to supply all the Ease.}”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Né þat mǫ́ttu \hld\ mę́rir tívar &
ok ginnręgin \hld\ of geta hvęrgi, &
unz af tryggðum \hld\ Týr Hlórriða &
ástráð mikit \hld\ ęinum sagði:\eva

\bvb But that might the renowned Tues and the \inx{Gin-Reins} nowhere get ahold of, until out of loyalty, a great word of loving advice Tue to Loride \name{= Thunder} alone did say:\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva „Býr fyr austan \hld\ Élivága &
hundvíss Hymir \hld\ at himins ęnda, &
á minn faðir \hld\ móðugr kętil, &
\edtext{rúmbrugðinn}{\Afootnote{‘rumbrygðan’ \AM}} hver \hld\ rastar djúpan.“\eva

\bvb “Lives to the east of the Ilewaves the houndwise Hymer, at the end of heaven. Owns my father\footnoteB{Hymer being Tue’s father.}, fierce, a kettle; a size-renowned cauldron one \inx{rest} deep.”\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva „Veiztu, ef þiggjum \hld\ þann lǫgvelli?“ &
„Ef, vinr, vélar \hld\ vit gørvum til!“\eva

\bvb “Knowest thou if we will receive that ale-boiler?” — “If, friend, we two make use of wiles!”\footnoteB{The speakers are not indicated, but it is most sensible that Thunder asks and Tue answers.}\evb
\evg

Hirði hann hafra \hld\ horngǫfgasta; &
hurfu at hǫllu \hld\ es Hymir átti.\eva

\bvb — They travelled with great strides from the beginning of the day, from Osyard, until to Agle’s they came—he herded bucks with the noblest of horns—they turned to the hall which Hymer owned.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Mǫgr fann ǫmmu, \hld\ mjǫk lęiða sér, &
hafði hǫfða \hld\ hundruð níu. &
ęn ǫnnur gekk \hld\ algollin framm &
brúnhvít bera \hld\ bjórvęig syni.\eva

\bvb The lad found his grandmother greatly loathsome; she had of heads nine hundred. But another woman, all-golden, stepped forth: white-browed, she carried a beer-draught for the son \ken*{= Tue}.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva „Áttniðr jǫtna \hld\ ek vilja’k ykr &
hugfulla tvá \hld\ und hvera sętja; &

gløggr við gęsti \hld\ gǫrr ills hugar.“\eva

\bvb “Kinsman of ettins! I would wish to set you high-mettled two under the cauldrons; my lover has many a time been stingy against guests, quick to ill temper.”\footnoteB{Tue’s mother (the all-golden woman in previous v.) wishes to hide him and Thunder, lest her husband (Hymer) find them.}\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Ęn váskapaðr \hld\ varð \edtext{síðbúinn}{\Afootnote{\emph{om.} \AM}}, &

gekk inn í sal, \hld\ glumðu jǫklar, &
vas karls, es kom, \hld\ kinnskógr frørinn.\eva

\bvb But the misshapen one was come late—the hard-minded Hymer—home from the hunt. He entered the hall—icicles clattered—frozen was the cheek-forest \ken{beard} of the churl who came.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva „Ves þú hęill, Hymir, \hld\ í hugum góðum! &
Nú ’s sonr kominn \hld\ til sala þinna, &
sá’s vit vę́ttum \hld\ af vęgi lǫngum; &
fylgir hǫ́num \hld\ Hróðrs andskoti, &
vinr verliða; \hld\ Véurr hęitir sá.\eva

\bvb “Be thou hale, Hymer, in good spirits!\footnoteB{Formula identically mirrored in runic inscription N B380: \emph{Heill sé þú / ok í hugum góðum. / Þórr þik þiggi, / Óðinn þik eigi.} “May thou be hale, and in good spirits! May Thunder receive thee, may Weden own thee.” Cf. also \Beowulf\ l. 407: \emph{Wæs þú Hróðgár hál!} “Be thou, Rothgar, hale!”} Now the son is come to thy halls, the one whom we two have been expecting, from a long way off. Follows him the opponent of Rooder <ettin> \ken*{= Thunder}, the friend of manly retinues \ken*{= Thunder}; Wighward \name{= Thunder} he is called.\evb

\bvb See where they sit, ’neath the hall’s gable: thus they hide themselves—a pillar stands before them!” The pillars sprang asunder before the sight of the ettin, but all in two the beam was broken.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Stukku átta, \hld\ ęn ęinn af þęim &
hverr harðslęginn \hld\ hęill af þolli; &

\bvb Eight\footnoteB{Eight kettles.} sprung apart, but one of them, a hard-forged kettle, [came] whole off its peg\footnoteB{Presumably the one in which Tue and Thunder were hiding.}. Forth went they, but the ancient ettin with his sight beheld\footnoteB{Literally “led with his sight”.} his opponent.\evb

\bvb His heart was not pleased then, when he saw the distresser of troll-women \ken*{= Thunder} come on the floor. There were three bulls taken: the ettin at once bade them be cooked.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Hvęrn létu þęir \hld\ hǫfði skęmra &
ok á sęyði \hld\ síðan bǫ́ru, &
át Sifjar verr \hld\ áðr sofa gingi, &
ęinn með ǫllu \hld\ øxn tvá Hymis.\eva

\bvb Each one they let shorten by a head, and onto the fire-pit then carried: ate the husband of Sib \ken*{= Thunder}, before he might go to sleep, alone all together two of Hymer’s oxen.\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Þótti hǫ́rum \hld\ Hrungnis spjalla &
verðr Hlórriða \hld\ vęl fullmikill, &
„munum at aptni \hld\ ǫðrum verða &
við vęiðimat \hld\ vér þrír lifa.“\eva

\bvb To the hoary friend of Rungner \name{ettin} \ken*{= Hymer} seemed Loride’s meal far too large; “next evening will we three by game-meat have to live.\footnoteB{Hymer’s stinginess (he refuses to share more of his own food, forcing his guests to go hunt) illustrates the otherness of the Ettins. See introduction to the poem.}”\evb
\evg


\bvg

„Hverf þú til \edtext{hjarðar}{\Afootnote{hallar \emph{(corr.)} \AM}}, \hld\ ef hug trúir, &
brjótr berg-Dana, \hld\ bęitur sǿkja.\eva

\bvb Wighward \name{= Thunder} called himself willing to row on the wave, if the baleful ettin might give pieces of bait. “Turn to the herd, if thou trust in thy heart—breaker of boulder-Danes \ken*{\textsc{ettins} > = Thunder}!—to seek pieces of bait.\evb
\evg

Svęinn sýsliga \hld\ svęif til skógar, &

\bvb I expect that the oxen for bait will not be easily caught by thee.”—The swain \name{= Thunder} sharply turned to the woods, there where an ox stood, all-black, before [him].\evb
\evg


\bvg
\bva Braut af þjóri \hld\ þurs ráðbani &
hǫ́tún ofan \hld\ horna tveggja. &
„Verk þikkja þín \hld\ verri myklu &
kjóla valdi \hld\ an kyrr sitir.“\eva

\bvb From the bull broke the treacherous slayer of the thurse \ken*{= Thunder} off the high meadow of the two horns \ken{head}, from above.—“Thy works seem far worse to the wielder of keels \ken*{= Hymer = me}, than if thou didst sit calm.\footnoteB{Hymer snidely belittles Thunder’s deed of pulling off the head of the ox (presumably by the horns).}”\evb
\evg

\bvg

lítla fýsi \hld\ lęngra at róa.\eva

\bvb The lord of he-goats \ken*{= Thunder} bade the kinsman of the \inx{ape}[C]\footnoteB{The specific meaning of \emph{api} (here rendered as “ape”) is highly uncertain. It seems to generally refer to a fool, but see Index.}\ [\textsc] to push the launching-steed \ken{ship} further out; but that ettin told of his scarce wish to row any longer.\footnoteB{The parallelism is notable, as Hymer, who just mocked Thunder, is now forced to do his willing by rowing.}\evb
\evg

\bvb Angered, the renowned Hymer pulled whales: one on the hook, soon up two; but back in the stern the one related to Weden \ken*{= Thunder}, Wighward \name{= Thunder}, cleverly made himself a fishing-line.\evb
\evg


\bvg

\bvb On the hook fastened he who saves men \ken*{= Thunder}—the lone slayer of the Worm \ken*{= Thunder}—the head of the ox. At the bait snapped the one whom the gods hate \ken*{= Middenyardsworm}—the surrounder of all lands \ken*{= Middenyardsworm}—from below.\evb
\evg

\bvb Daringly pulled deed-bold Thunder the venom-glistening Worm up on the gunwale; with the hammer he struck the high mountain of hair\footnoteB{A rather unfitting kenning, since serpent do not have hair.} \ken{head}—greatly hideous, from above—on the clash-brother of the Wolf \ken*{= Middenyardsworm}.\evb

\bvb The not joyous ettin, as they rowed back, [...], so that in the early morning\footnoteB{Assuming this is the correct reading, it would seem like the fishers have spent the whole night at sea, presumably with Hymer rowing all the way.} Hymer spoke nothing; he pulled the oar around, against the storm.\evb
