According to the prose of \Gylfaginning\, after the sons of \inx[P]{Byre} (that is, \inx[P]{Weden}, \inx[P]{Will} and \inx[P]{Wigh}) slew Yimer, so much blood flew from his wounds that all the race of Ettins were drowned, save for  Bearyelmer and his family, who survived by getting up on his \emph{lúðr}. In regular prose, \emph{lúðr} usually means ‘trumpet’, but it can also refer to a hollow tree-trunk.
