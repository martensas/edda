% Introduction.

{\small The “\inx{Spae} of the \inx{Wallow}” is attested in full in two principal versions. The earlier is the Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda, \Regius\ (GKS 2365 4to; 1270s), where it is the first poem, found on folios 1r–3r. The later is Hawksbook, \Hauksbok\ (AM 544 4to; 1300–75), where it is found at 20r–21r, in the middle of a large collection of saws and Catholics works. Many verses are also cited in \Gylfaginning, which here has the general siglum \GylfMS; to avoid confusion, it is only used when all the witness \Gylfaginning\ mss. agree. For it, I have here relied on Finnur Jónsson’s 1931 critical edition (Finnur 1931), while discarding his emendations. The noted mss. of it are:\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Codex Upsaliensis \Upsaliensis\ (DG 11; 1300–25)
	\item The Codex Upsaliensis \Upsaliensis\ (DG 11; 1300–25)
	\item The Codex Upsaliensis \Upsaliensis\ (DG 11; 1300–25)

Were the lower dwarves shaped out of soil, by the higher dwarves, Moodsown and Dorn, themselves made by the gods from Yime’s flesh and blood? “as Dorn said” would imply that Dorn did not shape the dwarves by own hands; did he and Moodsown shape the first lower dwarves out of stone, and then command these to finish the creation?}\evb

That will ever be remembered (\emph{þat mun æ uppi}, but both mss. \emph{þat mun enn uppi}), evil is the doom of the norns!”. The second is found in a runic inscription, U 323 (980–1015): “Ever will lie, while the eld lives (\textbf{meþ + altr + lifiʀ} \emph{með aldr lifir}), the hard-hammered bridge, broad, after a good man.”}, the tally of descendants, heaved to Lofer.\evb
