\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Heliand} (signum \Heliand; OS \emph{Hêljand} ‘Saviour’, cf. OE \emph{Hę̂lend}, OHG \emph{Heiland}) is an Old Saxon epic poem that narrates the life of Jesus.  Although based on the C9th Old High German translation of Tatian’s C2nd gospel harmony, the \emph{Diatessaron}, \Heliand\ is still an original work in the Saxon epic tradition, and betrays a creative spirit not afraid to interface with earlier, now-lost, pagan poetry.  It is by far the most important source of Old Saxon literature.

\subsection{Historical context}

We have a Latin preface preserved independently of \Heliand\ itself which can offer some external historical information about the poem.  The original manuscript of this short work is now lost, but it was fortunately printed by the Croatian reformer Flacius Illyricus in 1562.  It consists of two titled parts.

The first is in prose and entitled \emph{Praefatio ad librum antiquum in lingua Saxonica conscriptum} ‘Preface to an ancient book written in the Saxon language’.  This short text in turn appears to consist of two separate paragraphs.  According to the first, \Heliand\ was composed at the behest of emperor Ludwig (\emph{Ludowicus Augustus}, probably Ludwig “the Pious” 778–840, son of Charlemagne), who commanded a Saxon man, \emph{qui apud suos non ignobilis vates habebatur} ‘who was regarded among his own as a not undistinguished poet’ to render the entirety of the Old and New Testaments into Saxon verse.  Thus, the poet, \emph{a mundi creatione initium capiens, iuxta historiae veritatem quaeque excellentiora summatim decerpens, interdum quaedam ubi commodum duxit, mystico sensu depingens, ad finem totius Veteris ac Novi Testamenti interpretando more poetico satis faceta eloquentia perduxit,} ‘beginning with the creation of the world, and summarizing according to the truth of history the most significant events, at times depicting certain events with a mystical sense where he saw fit, led the interpretation, according to poetic custom and with rather witty eloquence, through to the end of the entire Old and New Testaments;’ further, \emph{iuxta morem vero illius poematis omne opus per vitteas distinxit, quas nos lectiones vel sententias possumus appellare} ‘according to the manner of that poem, he distinguished every work by \emph{fitts}, which we can call lessons or sentences.’

There is no reason to doubt the general truth of this account, although it is hard to believe that our unnamed poet should have rendered the entirety of the Old and New Testaments, even the prophets and epistles, into alliterative verse.  The antiquity of this paragraph of the preface is in any case certified by the use of the Germanic technical word \emph{vitteas} ‘fitts’, which, as pointed out already by Sievers (TODO), could not possibly have been known by a 16th century scholar.  The rendering of the Old Testament is probably to be identified with \SaxonGenesis, while the New Testament is what we have before us in \Heliand.

This first paragraph of the \emph{Praefatio} is then followed by a second, where we hear (in part) that, “they say that this same poet, while he was still entirely ignorant of this art, was warned in a dream to adapt the precepts of the Sacred Law into song, with a fitting melody in his own language.” (\emph{ferunt eundem Vatem dum adhuc artis huius penitus esset ignarus, in somnis esse admonitum, ut Sacrae Legis praecepta ad cantilenam propriae linguae congrua modulatione coaptaret.})   This narrative is clearly closely related to that which Bede (TODO) tells us about the illiterate Anglo-Saxon poet Cadman (see Cadman’s Hymn below); in fact its Latin wording is so close to that of Bede that it must have been plagiarised thence.  Finally, the same narrative is then told in Latin verse under the title \emph{Versus de poeta et interprete huius codicis} ‘Verses about the poet and interpreter of this codex’.

Whatever the truth of Cadman’s story, it can scarcely be the case that the poet(s) behind \Heliand\ and \SaxonGenesis\ were ignorant of the poetic art.  Both poems are wrought in an intricate style, and their composer must doubtless have been trained in the traditional craft, having first mastered the art of secular (or pagan) heroic poetry before he was commissioned to versify the Biblical texts; the first paragraph of the \emph{praefatio} itself tells us as much when it says that he “was regarded among his own as a not undistinguished poet”, and the idea that Emperor Ludwig would have commissioned a man entirely without poetic experience is obviously absurd.  This strongly suggests that the second paragraph of the \emph{praefatio} and the \emph{versus} are both later interpolations, and not of historical weight.

\subsection{Style and content}

It was for good reason that the poet was esteemed among his own, for he displays considerable mastery in such “Beowulfian” type scenes as the feast in the great mead-hall (2005–12, 2736–42), the stormy sea-voyage (2233–68, 2906–65), or the host asking for the identity of noble strangers come to his land (551–561); a mastery which reveals his training in traditional vernacular Saxon poetry dealing with heroic matters.  In fact, it is precisely in these passages that his poetry is most fluent, for it is here he can make the most use of his inherited stock of oral-formulaic expressions, synonyms, and kennings.  When our poet, by contrast has to deal with exclusively Christian matters, he is treading new ground, and it is it is apparent that his work suffers as a result.  This is in part due to the lack of traditional formulae for the new religion, and although he invents some (e.g. for Christ \emph{allaro barno bętst} ‘best of all babes’ and \emph{friðu-barn godes} ‘peace-child of God’), they quickly end up stale from overuse.  Another hinder is, as will be discussed shortly, his frequent moralising, which is entirely foreign to the genuine Germanic poetry.

Another notable traditional element found throughout the poem is the relationship between Christ and his Disciples, who are consistently described using the vocabulary of the Germanic warband (as found in earlier heroic poetry like \Beowulf\ and \Hildebrandslied).  Thus, the Disciples are brave “thanes” who express their undying loyalty towards their lord Jesus Christ through long heroic speeches, exclaiming their wish to win ever-lasting fame and glory by dying alongside him in the “dance of weapons” (e.g. Thomas at 3994–4002, Simon Peter at 4674–4689).  In conjunction with this there is an emphasis on the noble ancestry and high social status of the Disciples (e.g. 4003a) and especially Jesus and his family (e.g. 361b–367a), something which gives us an idea of the intended audience—these were members of the Saxon social elite, no mere commoners, and it was important for them that the heroes of the Gospel-story were of similarly high birth.

Still, we should not interpret such traditional elements as evidence for \Heliand\ reflecting a syncretist Germanic “warrior Christianity”, as some more romantic scholars have done.  It would not have been possible for the poet to excise the traditional heroic language—after all, he was hired to write an alliterative poem, and those elements were built into the very essence of the alliterative genre, and were necessary for the poetry to function in the social setting of courtly performance, and for it to work as poetry at all, for the alliteration itself required the existence of a large number of poetic synonyms and formulaic expressions.  It is thus within these confines that the poet relates the New Testament message, but that message is still one of pacifism and humility.  The New Testament is not a warlike text, and neither is \Heliand; regardless of its aesthetics, its \emph{ethics} are thoroughly Christian.

Although \Heliand\ generally adheres closely to Germanic poetic tradition in its language, we find important divergences in its content.  Here the heroic poetic tradition is turned against itself, and the Germanic warrior ideology comes under direct attack by means of its own specialised vocabulary, which is condemned not just in the speeches of Jesus Christ, but in the poet’s own, sermonising voice.  This is perhaps best seen in the episode of the Denial of Peter.  At the Last Supper Peter first makes a solemn speech (4674–4689), declaring in formal heroic language that he will not betray Jesus Christ, his lord, but stay with him until the end and give his life in battle; he swears upon his heart (\emph{hugi}) and strength of hand (\emph{hand-kraft}).  Jesus first praises Peter’s courage, and says that he indeed has a “thane’s heart” (\emph{þegnes hugi}), but then predicts that he will betray him thrice before cockcrow anyway.  Peter does just that, and upon hearing the cock repents by a lamenting speech (5012–5021).  The poet himself then delivers a short sermon on the events (5022–50)—if not even Peter, “the best of men” and “most valiant of thanes” could keep his promise without God’s help, what is its worth?  Man’s solemn vow (\emph{bi-hêt}, = OE \emph{béot} which is used positively in \Beowulf), pride (\emph{hróm}; cf. \Hildebrandslied\ 60), bravery (\emph{mód}), and strength of hand (\emph{hand-kraft}, by which Peter vowed) are all to no avail if the God’s grace should fail him due to his lack of faith.  Naturally, moral exegesis of this kind is totally foreign to the older pagan tradition.

In this context it is of value to talk about the language of war; although the New Testament is not a warlike text, the poet takes the opportunity to break out some traditional formulae when he can, e.g. at the arrest of Jesus (4866–4885).  Still, he is generally very restrained, and tries hard to avoid the active \emph{celebration} of war, probably because of its association with the warlike pre-Christian cult of Weden and his Walkirries and Oneharriers.  Where warlike sentiments are expressed by the Disciples (e.g. at the arrest, or in Peter’s vow at the Last Supper; see above) they are swiftly reproached by Jesus and ultimately proven flawed and misguided.  Traditional motifs like the greedy beasts of battle are entirely expunged, and the old feminine poetic synonyms \emph{*gu̇ðja} and \emph{hildi}, found in \Hildebrandslied\ and commonplace in Norse and English poetry, have not fared much better.  \emph{*gu̇ðja}, found in early OS female names and the non-\Heliand\ compound \emph{gu̇þ-fano} ‘field standard’, is entirely absent, and \emph{hildi} is only used twice (ll. 68, 5044)—in both cases disparagingly.  In their stead we find neuter-gender synonyms like \emph{stríd, ur-lagi, wíg}, and \emph{gi·winn}.  It is probably significant that \emph{Gunnr} and \emph{Hildr} are known as walkirries in the Norse tradition, and in the C9th were still actively worshipped in pagan Denmark, just to the north of Saxony.

It was described above how the depiction of the Disciples in their relationship as servants of Christ makes use of the language of the Germanic war-band, and that is the case when it comes to singular words, but although the Disciples are described as loyal thanes (\emph{þegnos}), heroes (\emph{hęliðos}, cf. \Hildebrandslied\ 6), and earls (\emph{erlos})—words perfectly fit for a Germanic war-band in a poem like \Beowulf—they are not a \emph{war}-band and are never described by explicitly warlike terms like \emph{hildi-skalkos} ‘war-servants’, \emph{wépạn-berandos} ‘weapon-bearers’, or \emph{helm-berandos} ‘helmet-bearers’.  Those terms—which in \Beowulf\ or Norse poetry could describe any group of warriors, including the protagonists—are instead given a derogatory sense, and for the most part refer only to the wicked Jews under their kings (68b, 765b, 2779b, 4811a).

There are, of course, other ways in which \Heliand\ departs from Germanic heroic tradition.  One that deserves mention is the treatment of hostile fate, which often plays a key role in driving the narrative in the old pagan legends (e.g. in \Hildebrandslied\ or the Walsing Cycle).  Although \Heliand\ refers to fated events by what are almost certainly originally pagan expressions like \emph{regano gi·skapu} ‘Shapes of the Reins’ and \emph{wurdi-gi·skapu} ‘Shapes of Weird’, fated events can also be called \emph{godes gi·skapu} ‘God’s Shapes’, for in the Christian worldview it is God that wields the destinies of Men—not the ambivalent Norns.

\subsection{Orthography}

Notes on the normalization:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Long vowels are marked by the acute rather than by the circumflex accent or macron. This is both faithful to the original manuscripts and concordant with my practice in normalising other Germanic languages.
    \item Long vowels \emph{ê} and \emph{ô} resulting from monophthongisation of diphthongs \emph{ai} and \emph{au} are, however, written with the circumflex accent. That these were in fact articulated separately is seen by the following circumstance: in the mss. etymological \emph{é} and \emph{ó} are frequently written as \emph{ie} and \emph{uo}, but this is never done for \emph{ê} and \emph{ô}.
    \item If attested in all mss., epenthetic (\emph{svara-bʰaktí}) vowels are marked with an underdot. Otherwise they are deleted.
    \item Unstressed \emph{a}-vowels reduced to \emph{e} in \textbf{C} are reverted back to \emph{a}
    \item Long vowels resulting from nasal assimilation are marked with an overdot. \emph{i} is written as \emph{ï}.
    \item ms. \emph{e} and \emph{i}, when occuring between vowels are written as \emph{j}.
    \item ms. \emph{i}, when word-initial or following \emph{g} and corresponding to etymological \emph{j} is written as \emph{j}
    \item ms. \emph{e} as resulting from \emph{i}-mutation is written as \emph{ę}.
    \item ms. \emph{b} or \emph{ƀ}, when representing the voiced bilabial fricative, is written as \emph{v}.
    \item ms. \emph{th} is written as \emph{þ}.
    \item ms. \emph{uu} is written as \emph{w}.
  \end{itemize}

The two main mss. are \textbf{M} and \textbf{C}.  Fragments \textbf{L} and \textbf{P} are identical in terms of handwriting and page layout and appear to have originally belonged to the same codex.  \textbf{V} also attests \SaxonGenesis, which suggests a close relation between that text and \Heliand.

\subsection{NOTE!}

The following edition is very much a work in progress.  The radically normalized orthography has been implemented, as has the marking of alliteration, but the original text has not been thoroughly critically edited, nor is there any English translation.
