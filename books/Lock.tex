Preserved in \Regius, directly following \Hymiskvida, though the poems without doubt were originally separate; the stylistic differences are drastical.

The poem has been interpreted as blasphemous (TODO: elaborate), but shows no linguistic signs of being particularly late.

\section{From Eagre and the gods (\emph{Frá Ę́gi ok goðum})}

\bpg\bpa Ę́gir, er ǫðru nafni hét Gymir, hann hafði búit ásum ǫl þá er hann hafði fengit ketil inn mikla sem nú er sagt. Til þeirar veizlu kom Óðinn ok Frigg kona hans. Þórr kom eigi þvíat hann var í austrvegi. Sif var þar, kona Þórs; Bragi, ok Iðunn kona hans. Týr var þar, hann var einhendr; Fenrisulfr sleit hǫnd af hánum, þá er hann var bundinn. Þar var Njǫrðr ok kona hans Skaði; Freyr ok Freyja; Víðarr son Óðins. Loki var þar, ok þjónustumenn Freys, Byggvir ok Beyla. Mart var þar ása ok alfa. Ę́gir átti tvá þjónustumenn; Fimafengr ok Eldir. Þar var lýsigull haft fyr eldsljós; sjalft barsk þar ǫl. Þar var griðastadr mikill. Menn lofuðu mjǫk hversu góðir þjónustumenn Ę́gis vóru. Loki mátti eigi heyra þat, ok drap hann Fimafeng. Þá skóku ę́sir skjǫldu sína ok ǿptu at Loka, ok eltu hann braut til skógar, en þeir fóru at drekka. Loki hvarf aptr ok hitti úti Eldi; Loki kvaddi hann:\epa

\bpb \inx[P]{Eagre}, who by another name is called \inx[P]{Gymer}, had prepared an ale-feast for the Ease when he had got the great kettle as now is told.\footnoteB{See the immediately preceding \Hymiskvida.}

To that gathering came \inx[P]{Weden} and \inx[P]{Frie}, his woman. \inx[P]{Thunder} came not, for he was on the \inx[L]{Eastern Way}. Sib was there, Thunder’s woman; \inx[P]{Bray} and \inx[P]{Idun}, his woman. \inx[P]{Tew} was there, he was one-handed. The \inx[P]{Fenrerswolf} tore his hand off when it was bound.\footnoteB{This detail is probably brought up to chronologically date the events of the poem as happening after the binding of Fenrer in the mythology.} There was \inx[P]{Nearth}, and his woman \inx[P]{Shede}; \inx[P]{Free} and \inx[L]{Frow}; \inx[P]{Wider}, the son of \inx[P]{Weden}. \inx[P]{Lock} was there, and the servants of Free: \inx[P]{Bew} and \inx[P]{Beal}. There was a great many of the \inx[G]{Ease} and \inx[G]{Elves}\footnoteB{A formulaic expression, see \inx[F]{Ease and Elves}.}.

Eagre had two servants: \inx[P]{Femfinger} and \inx[P]{Elder}. There was glowing gold used instead of fire; the ale there poured itself. There was a great \inx[C]{grith-stead}.\footnoteB{A place wherein all violence was forbidden, see Encyclopedia.} Men greatly praised how good the servants of Eagre were. Lock could not stand that, and he slew Femfinger.

Then the Ease shook their shields and screamed at Lock,\footnoteB{Some sort of ancient war dance. Cf. the Old Swedish Heathen Law: “He screams three nithing-screams TODO”.} and chased him away to the forest, but then they went to drink. Lock came back and found Elder outside; Lock greeted him:\epb\epg

The (lack of) alliteration here is very notable, and also occurs in st. 10 (between \emph{Víðarr} and \emph{ulfs}, see note there). It could simply be explained by the line being corrupt, but as there are no signs of that we ought to look for other explanations. I see two, namely that (a) the semi-vowel \emph{v} (\textipa{/w/}) is participating in vowel-alliteration with \emph{o}. Such an alliteration between \emph{v} and true vowels is never encountered in Scoldic poetry, but it might have been existed in the simpler Eddic styles; or that (2) the poem (or at least the relevant lines) is of such old age that it was composed before the North Germanic loss of \emph{v} before rounded vowels. This is supported by the fact that in both the present st. and st. 10 the words beginning with vowels (\emph{orð} ‘word’, \emph{ulfr} ‘wolf’) have cognates in other Germanic languages that begin with \emph{w}, and in the case of the word \emph{ulfr} this consonant is also attested in several old Scandinavian runic inscriptions. For metrical reasons the lines must postdate syncope, but on the basis of three clearly related C7th runestones from Blekinge (from Stentoften, Gummarp, and Istaby; DR 357–359) the loss of \emph{w} before rounded vowels is shown also to have occurred after some syncope (so DR 359 \textbf{h\textsc{a}þuwulafʀ} \emph{Haþuwulᵃfʀ}). Of course, even if the alliteration indeed is on \emph{v}, this does not require dating the whole poem to the late Proto-Norse period (indeed, according to the analysis done by \textcite{Sapp2022}, it is not even the linguistically oldest poem preserved); the older forms could simply be an archaism.

A C7th Proto-Norse form of the c-line might be: \emph{*mannagí ’s þéʀ in worðé winiʀ}.}}“\eva
