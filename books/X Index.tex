Cultural and religious terms

† \textbf{aught} (ON. \emph{ætt}, OE. \emph{ǣht})
 The Nordic (paternal) clan or family line.

† \textbf{fimble-} (ON. \emph{fimbul-})
 The ultimate, final, greatest. See \textbf{Fimblethyle}, \textbf{Fimblewinter}.

† \textbf{harrow} (ON. \emph{hǫrgr}, OE. \emph{hearg}, NWGmc. \emph{*harugaʀ})
 A cairn constructed for ritual purposes. \emph{Hind} 10 describes one: “A \textbf{harrow} he made for me, loaded with stones; now that stone-pile is become into glass. He reddened [it] in fresh blood of oxen; Oughthere ever trusted on the osennies.”

† \textbf{leed} (ON. \emph{ljóð}, OE. \emph{lēod})
 A song or chant with magical qualities.

† \textbf{thyle} (ON. \emph{þulr}, OE. \emph{þyle}, NWGmc. \emph{*þuliʀ})
 A sage who through rote learning has acquired a large amount of mythological lore (cf. \emph{þula} 'a list in poetic form; a meaningless poem' and \emph{þylja} 'to recite, to chant'). Thus \textbf{Weden} is the \textbf{Fimble-thyle}, being the unbeaten master of lore, as can be seen in his wisdom contests (see \emph{Alw}, \emph{Web}). Runic inscription DR 248 (Snoldelev) suggests the thyle was somehow bound to a specific place, and in Beowulf it seems to have been a court position, with \textbf{Unferth} being described as the "thyle of Rothgore".

† \textbf{wode} (ON. \emph{óðr}, OE. \emph{wōd}, NWGmc. \emph{*wōþuʀ})
 \textbf{Hean}'s gift to men, although the name would suggest it be from \textbf{Weden}. This word has several related meanings; ‘poetic inspiration’, ‘madness’, ‘rage’, although it in the later Skaldic corpus simply serves as a synonym for ‘poetry’.
