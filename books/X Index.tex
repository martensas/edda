Cultural and religious terms

† \textbf{aught} (ON. \emph{ætt}, OE. \emph{ǣht})
 The Nordic (paternal) clan or family line.

† \textbf{fimble-} (ON. \emph{fimbul-})
 The ultimate, final, greatest. See \textbf{Fimblethyle}, \textbf{Fimblewinter}.

† \textbf{harrow} (ON. \emph{hǫrgr}, OE. \emph{hearg}, NWGmc. \emph{*harugaʀ})
 A cairn constructed for ritual purposes. \emph{Hind} 10 describes one: “A \textbf{harrow} he made for me, loaded with stones; now that stone-pile is become into glass. He reddened [it] in fresh blood of oxen; Oughthere ever trusted on the osennies.” See also \textbf{wigh}.

† \textbf{leed} (ON. \emph{ljóð}, OE. \emph{lēod})
 A song or chant with magical qualities.

† \textbf{thyle} (ON. \emph{þulr}, OE. \emph{þyle}, NWGmc. \emph{*þuliʀ})
 A sage who through rote learning has acquired a large amount of mythological lore (cf. \emph{þula} 'a list in poetic form; a meaningless poem' and \emph{þylja} 'to recite, to chant'). Thus \textbf{Weden} is the \textbf{Fimble-thyle}, being the unbeaten master of lore, as can be seen in his wisdom contests (see \emph{Alw}, \emph{Web}). Runic inscription DR 248 (Snoldelev) suggests the thyle was somehow bound to a specific place, and in Beowulf it seems to have been a court position, with \textbf{Unferth} being described as the "thyle of Rothgore".

† \textbf{wigh} (ON. \emph{vé}, OE. \emph{wēoh}, \emph{wīh}, NWGmc. \emph{*wīhą})
 A holy shrine or sanctuary. It seems that where the \textbf{harrow} was a pile of stones or cairn used for carrying out rituals, the wigh was an enclosed space. The earliest attestation seems to be runic inscription Ög N288 (Oklunda), which reads: “Guthhere <= Gunnarr> painted these runes, and he fled, guilty. Sought this wigh, and he fled into this clearing. And he bound. [...]” The implication seems to be that the wigh was considered so sacred that Guthhere could not be apprehended or punished for his crime while in it. — In Old English the word means ‘pagan idol’. It is not immediately clear which meaning is the original one, but in this edition the Norse sense has been adopted, since the Anglo-Saxon sources are all of a Christian nature. The \emph{Beewolf} name Wighstone (\emph{Wīh-} or \emph{Wēohstān}) in any case suggest the Norse meaning, since ‘idol-stone’ makes little sense.

† \textbf{wode} (ON. \emph{óðr}, OE. \emph{wōd}, NWGmc. \emph{*wōþuʀ})
 \textbf{Hean}'s gift to men, although the name would suggest it be from \textbf{Weden}. This word has several related meanings; ‘poetic inspiration’, ‘madness’, ‘rage’, although it in the later Skaldic corpus simply serves as a synonym for ‘poetry’.
