\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Spae of the Wallow} (\Voluspa) is the most comprehensive mythological text surviving from Heathen times.  The poem is a \inx[C]{spae} (\emph{spǫ́} ‘prophecy’) in the form of a monologue spoken by a \inx[C]{wallow} (\emph{vǫlva} ‘seeress, sibyl, prophetess’) summoned by the god Weden in order to relate mythological knowledge.  Weden’s frequent journeys to question various beings about mythological lore should be seen in the light of his incessant lust for knowledge and wisdom.  The most similar instance is \Baldrsdraumar, wherein Weden summons another wallow out of her grave in \inx[L]{Hell} in order to find out why the god \inx[P]{Balder} is having ominous nightmares.  There is also \Vafthrudnismal, wherein Weden challenges the wise ettin \inx[P]{Webthrithner} to a wisdom contest and defeats him.  These journeys are further alluded to in \Harbardsljod\ TODO.

In its being a mythic catalogue \Voluspa\ also resembles (parts of) poems like \Havamal, \Grimnismal, \Sigrdrifumal, and \Allvismal, but it differs from them all in a key way: instead of being a motley collection of scattered mythological lore, \Voluspa\ offers a chronological overview of the whole Norse mythic timeline, from the creation of the world to its demise and rebirth.  That is not to say that the events in it clearly described; they are related in a highly allusive fashion that presupposes that the audience is already familiar with them.  There may also be some later omissions and inserts that make the poem more difficult to read.

\Voluspa\ is attested in full in two independent recensions.  The first and most important is \Regius, where it is the first poem and found on foll. 1r–3r; the other is \Hauksbok, where it is found in the middle of a large collection of saws and Catholics works at 20r–21r.

Many stanzas from the poem are also cited or paraphrased in \Gylfaginning, for which \Voluspa\ was clearly one of the main sources.  These paraphrases are still of critical value, e.g. in st. 19, where \emph{sal} ‘hall’ in the paraphrase agrees with \Hauksbok\ against \Regius\ \emph{sę́} ‘lake’.  For the four mss. of \Gylfaginning—\RegiusProse, \Trajectinus, \Wormianus, and \Upsaliensis—see the General Introduction.

For the differences between the mss. the reader may consult the following table prepared by the editor.  The several stanzas in \Gylfaginning, which are quoted independently and with little relation to the order of the original poem, are marked with plus signs.  The sequences containg uninterrupted quotations of several stanzas are marked with an incrementing alphabetic symbol, so that \emph{B1} is the first stanza in the second sequence, and so on.  When a stanza found in a ms. is strongly divergent (e.g. st. 10, where \Gylfaginning\ omits the first two half-lines), its number is followed by a star.  The stanzas beginning with \emph{Þȧ gingu ręgin ǫll} ‘Then went the Reins all’ are represented by the half-line immediately following.

The poem begins with a bid for silence (1), and the wallow recalling her earliest memories (2). She then recounts the ordering of the world by the gods (3–6) and the golden age of peace and plenty (7–8), which is, however, interrupted by the intrusion of three unidentified ettin-maidens (8, and see note there). After this follow two verses about the shaping of the dwarfs (9–10), and then several originally separate \emph{dwarf-tallies} (11–15), which are without doubt later inserts. Returning to the main narrative thread is described the creation and endowment of the first man and woman (16–17), Ugdrassle’s Ash (18), and the three \inx[G]{norns} living under it (19).

This is where the two full recensions of the poem diverge. Because of its older age and larger count of verses I have here followed the order of \Regius: the wallow recalls how a woman named Goldwey was sacrificed and reborn three times (20), and how she, under the name Heath, practiced sorcery and witchcraft (21). She then recalls the first war in the world, between the Eese and Wanes (22–23), and alludes to the slaying of the smith, who according to \Gylfaginning\ 42 was promised \inx[P]{Frow} and the sun and moon in exchange for building the wall of Osyard (24-25). This is followed by a cryptic verse describing Homedal’s hidden silence or hearing (26).

In \Hauksbok\ the structure is quite different. After the description of the norns (19), the Eese go to decide what action to take regarding the promising of Frow to the ettin (my 24-25), and Homedal’s hearing is described (26). Then follows the two verses about the old hag in Ironwood who raises the wolves that will swallow the sun and moon (40-41). After this come verses 20–23 in the same order as \Regius\ (see above).

The leek was valued in folk magic, as seen already on gold bracteates from the C5th and C6th, where it appears as a charm word in the form {ᛚᚨᚢᚲᚨᛉ} \emph{laukaʀ}, in one inscription paired with {ᛚᛁᚾᚨ} \emph{lína} ‘linen’.  Classical Norse attestations of magic use include \Sigrdrifumal\ 8, where the leek is thrown into mead against poison; and the \Volsathattr, where a horse penis is said to be \emph{\alst{l}íni gǿddr \hld\ en \alst{l}aukum studdr} ‘endowed with linen and supported by leeks’ in a poetic line.  The leek was particularly associated with women and domestic life, as seen by its pairing with “linen”.  Kennings for women frequently have the leek as a determinant (TODO: Meissner reference?), and Anon \emph{Sveinfl} 1 (\Skp\ I TODO.) sarcastically states that a battle was not \emph{sem manni \hld\ mę́r lauk eða ǫl bę́ri} ‘as if a maiden brought a man leek or ale’.}}.\eva

According to \Gylfaginning\ 14 the dwarfs first originated as maggots in the corpse of Yimer, out of whose bones the rocks were made (\Grimnismal\ 41, \Vafthrudnismal\ 21).  Dwarfs dwell in the rocks and earth; cf. for instance \Ynglingatal\ 2, where the Swedish king Swayther (\emph{Svęigðir} disappears into a rock in pursuit of a dwarf.  More difficult to explain is the creation of dwarfs out of Yimer’s blood (from which was made the sea, \Grimnismal\ 41, \Vafthrudnismal\ 21), since dwarfs are never said to dwell in water. — If one chooses the reading \emph{Bláinn} ‘Blown’ (named in the \inx[C]{thule}[thules] as a dwarf) instead of \emph{blǫ́um} ‘blue-black’, then following Gurevich (\emph{Skp} 2017, p. 693) one may see a kenning “the legs of Blown \name{dwarf} \ken{stone}”.

{\small Sts. 11–15 contain two originally distinct lists of dwarf-names; part of them are almost certainly later inserts.  There is a repetition of names (Oakenshield, Great-grandfather), and more than one formulaic conclusion.

Sts. 11–13, having no repeated names, seem to belong together. If they do, st. 12, which contains the formulaic conclusion to the list, should probably switch places with 13.

Sts. 14–15 form the second group, having an introduction and a conclusion which both mention the dwarf Loffer.}

strong and lovely Eese along the settlement; \\
they found on land the little availing \\
Ash and Emble, \inx[C]{orlay}-less.\footnoteB{This verse is paraphrased in \Gylfaginning\ 9: \emph{Þá er þeir gengu með sę́var-strǫndu Bors synir, fundu þeir tré tvau ok tóku upp trén ok skǫpuðu af menn. Gaf inn fyrsti ǫnd ok líf, annarr vit ok hrę́ring, þriði á-sjónu, mál ok heyrn ok sjón, gáfu þeim klę́ði ok nǫfn. Hét karl-maðrinn Askr, en konan Embla, ok ólst þaðan af mann-kindin, sú er byggðin var gefinn undir Mið-garði.} ‘When the sons of Byre (cf. st. 4) walked along the sea-shore they found two trees and they took up the trees and shaped men from them. The first one gave breath (\emph{ǫnd}) and life, the second wit and movement, the third sight, speech, appearance and sight; they gave them clothes and names. The male was called Ash, and the woman Emble, and from them mankind was begotten, to whom were given the dwelling within Middenyard.’

The ON cognate of tree, \emph{tré}, can also mean ‘pieces of wood’, and it is traditionally seen as referring to pieces of driftwood. Yet as pointed out by \textcite{Hultgård2006} the comparative evidence suggests that the two were in fact living, growing trees (they would thus be part of the foliage described in st. 4) and there is nothing in the sources that speaks against this.

While Ash is easily identified with the same-named wood species (\emph{Fraxinus excelsior}), the etymology of Emble is much more difficult. The shaping of men from trees is used by poets in various kennings for men and women, especially in Scaldic poetry (for a short discussion see \textciteshorttitle{SkP} I, p. lxxv ff.). While this is rarer in the Eddic corpus it does occur, e.g. in \Sigrdrifumal\ 5: \emph{bryn-þings apaldr} ‘apple-tree of the byrnie-\inx[C]{Thing} \ken{battle > warrior}’.}\evb\evg

{\small Told allusively in \Voluspa\ 31–33 is the myth about Balder’s death.  Balder, the son of Weden and Frie, was slain with an arrow shot by his blind half-brother Hath, whose hand was guided by Lock.  Weden could not slay Hath, who was his son, and so he seduced the woman Rind, apparently through love-magic (Cormac Awmundson’s TODO: \emph{sęið Yggr til rindar} ‘Ug won Rind through sorcery’).  Rind gave birth to Wonnel, who grew very fast; after just one day he was big enough to kill Hath, which he also did, avenging Balder’s death.  The other important sources for this myth are \Baldrsdraumar\ 8–11, \Gylfaginning\ 49, and \textcite{Saxo} 3.4.1–8.

The language of \Baldrsdraumar\ is so similar to the present sts. that they must be of common origin; \Baldrsdraumar\ 11/2–4 is near-identical to \Voluspa\ 32/4–33/2.  The biggest narrative difference is that \Baldrsdraumar\ mentions Rind, who is not found in \Voluspa.

The most elaborate narrative is found in \Gylfaginning\ 49, which may be shortly summarised as follows: Balder has terrible nightmares about his own death, and so his mother Frie makes all sorts of things (fire, water, venom, metals, stones, trees, diseases, beasts, et. c.) swear oaths not to harm him.  After this the Eese make sport of shooting and striking at him, since he cannot be harmed.  Lock is annoyed by this and approaches Frie while disguised as a woman.  He finds out from her that there is one thing that did not swear the oath—the mistletoe, which was thought too young.  Lock takes a mistletoe and a bow and gives it to the blind god Hath, showing him where to shoot.  Hath does so, and kills Balder.  After this \Gylfaginning\ describes Balder’s funeral (treated poetically in Wolf Ugson’s fragmentary \emph{House-drape}, ÚlfrU \emph{Húsdrp} in \Skp\ III) and how the gods attempted to “weep Balder out of hell”, which failed (see Eddic Fragments in the present ed.)  \Gylfaginning\ 50 goes on to describe how the Eese punished Lock (see st. 34 below.)

It is notable that \Gylfaginning\ 49–50 fails to mention Wonnel.  This part of the myth may have been left out for moral reasons, but was certainly known to the author of the Prose Edda; cf. \Gylfaginning\ 30: \emph{Áli eða Váli heitir einn, sonr Óðins ok Rindar. Hann er djarfr í orrostum ok mjǫk happ-skęytr} ‘Onnel or Wonnel one is called, the son of Weden and Rind. He is brave in battles and a very lucky shot’ and \Skaldskaparmal\ 19: \emph{Hvernig skal kenna Vála? Svá, at kalla hann son Óðins ok Rindar, [\dots] hefni-ás Baldrs, dólg Haðar ok bana hans, [\dots]} ‘How shall one ken Wonnel? Namely by calling him the son of Weden and Rind, [\dots] avenging \inx[C]{os} of Balder, the foe of Hath and his bane, [\dots].’

The last source is \textcite{Saxo} 3.4.1–8, who retells the revenge narrative in typical euhemerized form; his versions of Hath and Balder are distinctly human generals and rulers. It may be summarized as follows: Weden takes counsel from a group of seers; one of them, Horsethief the Finn, foretells that Rind, daughter of the Russian king, will bear him another son to avenge Balder.  Weden soon enlists in the king’s army and leads it to great victories, but is continually spurned by the daughter.  He tries various other disguises but is still refused.  At last he disguises himself as an old woman and becomes her physician.  When she turns sick, he binds her, supposedly in order to give her a certain foul potion—he instead rapes her, apparently with her father’s consent.  Their son, Bo, grows up to become a fierce raider.  One day Weden summons him and reminds him of his duty to avenge his brother, Balder.  Bo slays Hath in a duel, but soon perishes from his wounds.}%TODO: add Saxo’s Latin names in parenthesis

	‘Then spoke Gangler: “What will then remain, when heaven and earth and the whole world is burned, and gods are dead and all the Oneharriers and all man-kind—and [still] ye have said earlier, that each man will live in some world for all ages?”

	Then answers Third: “Many good dwellings are there then, and many ill: it is then best to be in Gimlee in the heaven, and it is very good of good drink for those who find joy in that, in the hall which is called Brimmer; it also stands in heaven. Another good hall is the one which stands on the Nithfells, made from red gold; it is called Sinder. In these halls good and well-mannered men will dwell.

	On Neestrand is a great and bad hall, and its doors face north. It is all woven with the spines of serpents like a wicker-house, but the heads of the serpents all look into the house and blow venom, so that through the hall rivers of venom run, and in those rivers wade oath-breakers and murder-wargs, as is said here:”’

The crimes are what one might expect from the Germanic worldview: perjury, shameful murder, and adultery with a married woman. In Anglo-Saxon and Nordic laws the committer of such crimes gained the title of \inx[C]{nithing}, that is, one afflicted with \inx[C]{nithe} (severe shame). It is not surprising then that such nithings would be tortured by a creature named Nithehewer ‘Nithe-striker’. The practice of burying in bogs and flood-marks (or generally outside of settlements) is well attested in sources about Germanic culture from Tacitī Germania onwards—I consider it likely that the heavy streams in this stanza and others represent such graves. This is further elaborated on in \textcite{GermanicGems2}.}\evb\evg

\bvb In the east dwells the old woman, in \inx[L]{Ironwood}, \\
and nourishes there the kindreds of \inx[P]{Fenrer} \ken{wolves}; \\
from them all comes one most certain: \\
a seizer of the Moon in a troll’s \inx[C]{hame}.\footnoteB{The old hag raises the cubs of the wolf Fenrer, of which a particularly fierce one will swallow the moon. According to \Grimnismal\ 40 the sun is chased by a wolf called Skoll, while another wolf, Hate Rothswitner’s son, runs in front of her. This is elaborated upon in \Gylfaginning\ 12, where it is said that Skoll swallows the moon, while Hate swallows the sun. High then explains that “A lone troll-woman (\emph{gýgr}) lives to the east of Middenyard in that forest called Ironwood”, and “feeds the sons of many ettins, all in the likenesses of wolves, and thereof these wolves (i.e. Skoll and Hate) come. And it is also said that from that lineage a single one becomes the mightiest, and he is called \inx[P]{Moongarm}. He fills himself with the life of all those men who die and he swallows the moon and stains heaven and all the air with blood. Thereof the sun loses its rays and the winds are violent and moan hither and thither, and thus it says in the Spae of the Wallow: [...]” after which this and the following st. are quoted. This seems very much like a composite from several sources—probably \Voluspa\ 40–41 and \Grimnismal\ 40—but becomes contradictory when it states that two wolves swallow the moon.
Assuming that this is only a confusion on the part of the author of \Gylfaginning, this st. and the next must be describing Skoll, but it is of course not impossible that there was confusion about the exact details of these events among the Heathen poets. In favour of that seems to speak \Vafthrudnismal\ 46–47, where the sun is said to be swallowed by Fenrer (but see note there).}\evb\evg

{\small With the last repetition of the refrain stanza the destruction has reached its apex.  Sts. 56–59 are paraphrased in \Gylfaginning\ ch. 53:

\begin{quote}
	\emph{Þá mę́lti Gangleri: „Hvárt lifa nǫkkur goðin þá, eða er þá nǫkkur jǫrð eða himinn?“ Hárr segir: „Upp skýtr jǫrðunni þá ór sę́num, ok er þá grǿn ok fǫgr. Vaxa þá akrar ó·sánir. Víðarr ok Váli lifa, svá at eigi hefir sę́rinn ok Surta-logi grandat þeim, ok byggja þeir á Iða-velli, þar sem fyrr var Ás-garðr, ok þar koma þá synir Þórs, Móði ok Magni, ok hafa þar Mjǫllni. Því nę́st koma þar Baldr ok Hǫðr frá Heljar, setjast þá allir samt, ok talast við, ok minnast á rúnar sínar, ok rǿða of tíðendi þau, er fyrrum hǫfðu verit, of Mið-garðs-orm ok um Fenris-úlf. Þá finna þeir í grasinu gull-tǫflur þę́r, er ę́sirnir hǫfðu átt. Svá er sagt:“}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	‘Then spoke Gangler: “Do any of the gods then live, or is there then any earth or heaven?”  High says: “The earth then shoots up from the seas, and it is then green and fair.  Then grow acres unsown.  Wider and Wonnel live, for the sea and Surt’s flame have not harmed them, and they settle on the Idewolds where there earlier was Osyard; and then the sons of Thunder, Mood and Main, come there, and there they have Millner.  Next come Balder and Hath from Hell; then they all make peace with each other and discuss and think back on their runes, and speak about the tidings which had been in antiquity, about the Middenyardswyrm and about the Fenrerswolf.  Then they find in the grass those golden game-bricks which the Eese had owned. So it is said:”’

\section{Stanzas from \Hauksbok}

\Hauksbok\ has a few substantial insertions and differences.  Their style strongly suggests that they are later compositions.

\sectionline

{\small Ll. 1–2 of st. 34 are replaced by the following.}
