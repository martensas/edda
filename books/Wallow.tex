The \textbf{Spae of the Wallow} is the most comprehensive mythological text surviving from Heathen times.

The poem is attested in full in two independent recensions. The first is \Regius, where it is the first poem, found on folios 1r–3r. The second is \Hauksbok, where it is found at 20r–21r in the middle of a large collection of saws and Catholics works. Many verses are also cited in \Gylfaginning, large parts of which are directly based on the poem. Other verses are not attested directly, but are instead paraphrased. The paraphrases may still have critical value (so e.g. st. 19, where \emph{sal} in the parapharse corroborates \Hauksbok). For its constituent manuscripts see the General Introduction. %TODO: elaborate?

As seen from the title, the poem is a \inx[C]{spae} (\emph{spǫ́} ‘prophecy’) in the form of a monologue spoken by a \inx[C]{wallow} (\emph{vǫlva} ‘seeress, sibyl, prophetess’), summoned by Weden in order to relate mythological knowledge. The motif of Weden journeying to ask beings (whether ettins or wallows) is also seen in other sources. Closest is \Baldrsdraumar, wherein Weden summons a wallow out of her grave in \inx[L]{Hell} in order to understand why the god \inx[P]{Balder} is having ominous nightmares. There is also \Vafthrudnismal, wherein Weden challenges the wise ettin \inx[P]{Webthrithner} to a wisdom contest and defeats him. These journeys are also alluded to in \Harbardsljod\ 43–46.

In its being a mythic catalogue it also resembles the latter part of \Havamal, \Grimnismal, \Sigrdrifumal\ and \Allvismal, though it differs from them in a key way: it gives a (mostly?) complete chronological overview of the whole mythic timeline, from the creation to the end and rebirth of the world. That is not to say that the events are clearly described; they are related in a highly allusive fashion—certainly presupposing that the audience already be familiar with them. There may also be gaps and later inserts that make the poem more difficult.

The poem begins with a bid for silence (1), and the wallow recalling her earliest memories (2). She then recounts the ordering of the world by the gods (3–6) and the golden age of peace and plenty (7–8), which is, however, interrupted by the intrusion of three unidentified ettin-maidens (8, and see note there). After this follow two verses about the shaping of the dwarfs (9–10), and then several originally separate \emph{dwarf-tallies} (11–15), which are without doubt later inserts. Returning to the main narrative thread is described the creation and endowment of the first man and woman (16–17), Ugdrassle’s Ash (18), and the three \inx[G]{norns} living under it (19).

This is where the two full recensions of the poem diverge. Because of its older age and larger count of verses I have here followed the order of \Regius: the wallow recalls how a woman named Goldwey was sacrificed and reborn three times (20), and how she, under the name Heath, practiced sorcery and witchcraft (21). She then recalls the first war in the world, between the Eese and Wanes (22–23), and alludes to the slaying of the smith, who according to \Gylfaginning\ 42 was promised \inx[P]{Frow} and the sun and moon in exchange for building the wall of Osyard (24-25). This is followed by a cryptic verse describing Homedall’s hidden silence or hearing (26).

In \Hauksbok\ the structure is quite different. After the description of the norns (19), the Eese go to decide what action to take regarding the promising of Frow to the ettin (my 24-25), and Homedall’s hearing is described (26). Then follows the two verses about the old hag in Ironwood who raises the wolves that will swallow the sun and moon (40-41). After this come verses 20–23 in the same order as \Regius\ (see above).

To illustrate the differences between mss., and which verses are attested in which, I have prepared the following table showing the order of stanzas by manuscript, compared to the present edition.  As several stanzas in \GylfMS\ are quoted on their own, with little relation to the order of the original poem, they are simply marked with plus signs.  When stanzas are quoted in sequence, they are preceded by an alphabetically incrementing letter denoting which sequence they belong to.  When a stanza found in a ms. differs majorly from the pres. ed. (e.g. st. 10 where \GylfMS\ omits the first two half-lines), it is marked with a star.  The stanzas beginning with \emph{Þȧ gingu ręgin ǫll} ‘Then went the Reins all’ are represented by the half-line immediately following.

The leek was particularly associated with women and domestic life, as seen by its pairing with “linen”.

after which he describes the creation of the dwarfs (see next stanza).}\evb\evg

Dwarfs dwell in the rocks and earth; cf. for instance \Ynglingatal\ 2, where the Swedish king Swayther (\emph{Svęigðir} disappears into a rock in pursuit of a dwarf. More difficult to explain is the creation of dwarfs out of Yimer’s blood (which according to \Grimnismal\ TODO and \Vafthrudnismal\ TODO is the sea), since dwarfs are never said to dwell in water. — If one chooses the reading \emph{Bláinn} ‘Blown’ (named in the \inx[C]{thule}[thules] as a dwarf) instead of \emph{blǫ́um} ‘blue-black’, then following Gurevich (\emph{Skp} 2017, p. 693) one may see a kenning “the legs of Blown \name{dwarf} \ken{stone}”.

 %TODO: move these verses to appendix?

{\small Sts. 11–15 contain two originally separate lists of dwarfs. That they are separate is seen by the repetition of names (Oakenshield, Great-grandfather), and their having their own conclusions.

Sts. 11–13, having no repeated names, seem to belong together. If they do, st. 12, which contains the formulaic conclusion to the list, should probably switch places with 13.

Sts. 14–15 form the second group, having an introduction and a conclusion which both mention the dwarf Loffer.}

\bvb Until three came out of that host: \\
strong and lovely Eese along the settlement; \\
they found on land the little availing \\
Ash and Emble, \inx[C]{orlay}-less.\footnoteB{This verse is paraphrased in \Gylfaginning\ 9: \emph{Þá er þeir gengu með sę́var-strǫndu Bors synir, fundu þeir tré tvau ok tóku upp trén ok skǫpuðu af menn. Gaf inn fyrsti ǫnd ok líf, annarr vit ok hrę́ring, þriði á-sjónu, mál ok heyrn ok sjón, gáfu þeim klę́ði ok nǫfn. Hét karl-maðrinn Askr, en konan Embla, ok ólst þaðan af mann-kindin, sú er byggðin var gefinn undir Mið-garði.} ‘When the sons of Byre (cf. st. 4) walked along the sea-shore they found two trees and they took up the trees and shaped men from them. The first one gave breath (\emph{ǫnd}) and life, the second wit and movement, the third sight, speech, appearance and sight; they gave them clothes and names. The male was called Ash, and the woman Emble, and from them mankind was begotten, to whom were given the dwelling within Middenyard.’

The ON cognate of tree, \emph{tré}, can also mean ‘pieces of wood’, and it is traditionally seen as referring to pieces of driftwood. Yet as pointed out by \textcite{Hultgård2006} the comparative evidence suggests that the two were in fact living, growing trees (they would thus be part of the foliage described in st. 4) and there is nothing in the sources that speaks against this.

While Ash is easily identified with the same-named wood species (\emph{Fraxinus excelsior}), the etymology of Emble is much more difficult. The shaping of men from trees is used by poets in various kennings for men and women, especially in scoldic poetry (for a short discussion see \textciteshorttitle{SkP} I, p. lxxv ff.). While this is rarer in the Eddic corpus it does occur, e.g. in \Sigrdrifumal\ 4: \emph{brynþings apaldr} ‘apple-tree of the byrnie-\inx[C]{Thing} \ken{battle > warrior}’.}\evb\evg

{\small Told allusively in \Voluspa\ 31–33 is the myth about the Balder’s death at the hands of his blind brother Hath, and the revenge killing of Hath by his half-brother Wonnel, who was specifically begotten for that purpose.  The other important sources for this myth are \Baldrsdraumar\ 8–11, the detailed description in \Gylfaginning\ 49, and Saxo Grammaticus (III.4.1–8).

The account and language of \Baldrsdraumar\ 8–11 is strikingly similar to the present sts. (and \Baldrsdraumar\ 11/2–4 is near-identical to \Voluspa\ 32/4–33/2), and they give only one detail not found in the present sts., namely that Wonnel, the slayer of Hath, was born from a woman named Rind “in the western halls”.

\Gylfaginning\ 49 contains a much longer and more detailed narrative.  It may be shortly summarised as follows: After Balder has terrible nightmares about dying, his mother Frie makes all sorts of things (fire, water, venom, metals, stones, trees, diseases, beasts, etc.) swear oaths not to harm him.  Since Balder is now practically unharmable, the Eese make sport out of shooting and striking him.  Lock is annoyed by this game, and in disguise as a woman, he finds out from Frie that a single thing did not swear the oath: the mistletoe, since it was thought too young.  Lock grabs a mistletoe and gives it to the blind god Hath, telling him where to shoot.  Hath does so, and Balder dies.

\Gylfaginning\ 49 continues with the rest of the narrative, namely the failed attempt by the Eese at “crying Balder out of hell” (for which see Eddic Fragments in the present volume) and Balder’s funeral (which is treated poetically in Wolf Ugson’s fragmentary \emph{House-drape}, ÚlfrU \emph{Húsdrp} in \Skp\ III.)  For the revenge taken by the Eese on Lock, treated in \Gylfaginning\ 50, see st. 34 below.

A very notable omission in \Gylfaginning\ 49–50 is the slaying of Hath by his half-brother Wonnel.  This brother-slaying may have been left out for moral reasons, but was certainly known to the author, as seen by \Gylfaginning\ 30, which reads in full: \emph{Áli eða Váli heitir einn, sonr Óðins ok Rindar. Hann er djarfr í orrostum ok mjǫk happ-skęytr.} ‘Onnel or Wonnel one is called, the son of Weden and Rind. He is brave in battles and a very lucky shot’, and by \Skaldskaparmal\ 19, where we find the following relevant kennings for Wonnel (with case changed from the acc. to the nom. for clarity): \emph{sonr Óðins ok Rindar} ‘son of Weden and Rind’ and \emph{hefni-áss Baldrs, dólgr Haðar ok bani hans} ‘avenging \inx[C]{os} of Balder; the enemy of Hath and his bane’.

The revenge narrative is also dealt with by Saxo (III.4.1–8) in his typical euhemerized form (for Saxo’s Latin forms of relevant names see respective Encyclopedia entries): Weden learned from the Finnish wizard Horsethief that Rind, daughter of the Russian king,

Weden (who could not murder his own son) seduced the woman Rind (in the by Cormac Awmundson’s TODO: \emph{sęið Yggr til rindar}), who gave birth to Wonnel.}

Second, although it must was at some point used in the singular in the generic sense ‘god’, and this survives in compounds like \emph{Sig-týr} ‘Victory-tew \name{= Weden}’ and in the plural \emph{tívar} ‘tews; gods’, in the ON corpus the simplex form \emph{týr} exclusively refers to the god \inx[C]{Tew}.

	\emph{Þá svarar Þriði: „Margar eru þá vistir góðar ok margar illar; batst er þá at vera á Gimléi á himni, ok all-gótt er til góðs drykkjar þeim, er þat þykkir gaman, í þeim sal, er Brimir heitir; hann stendr ok á himni. Sá er ok góðr salr, er stendr á Niða-fjǫllum, gørr af rauðu gulli; sá heitir Sindri. Í þessum sǫlum skulu byggja góðir menn ok sið-látir.}

	\emph{Á Ná-strǫndum er mikill salr ok illr ok horfa norðr dyrr; hann er ok ofinn allr orma-hryggjum sem vanda-hús, en orma hǫfuð ǫll vitu inn í húsit ok blása eitri, svá at eptir salnum renna eitr-ár, ok vaða þę́r ár eið-rofar ok morð-vargar, svá sem hér segir:“}

\begin{quote}
	‘Then spoke Gangler: “What will then be afterwards, when heaven and earth and all the world is burned, and dead are the gods and all Oneharriers and all man-kind—and ye have said earlier, that each man will live in some world for all ages?”

	Then answers Third: “Many good dwellings are there then, and many bad: it is then best to be on Gimlee in heaven, and it is all-good with good drink, for those who find that pleasurable, in the hall which is called Brimmer; it also stands on heaven. That one is also a good hall which stands on the Nithfells, made of red gold; it is called Sinder. In these halls good and well-mannered men will dwell.

	On Neestrand is a great and bad hall, and the doors face north. It is all woven with the spines of serpents like a wicker-house, but the heads of the serpents all face into the house and blow venom, so that along the hall run venom-rivers, and in those rivers wade oath-breakers and murder-wargs, as is said here:”’

It is not surprising then that such nithings would be tortured by a creature named Nithehewer ‘Nithe-striker’. The practice of burying in bogs and flood-marks (or generally outside of settlements) is well attested in sources about Germanic culture from Tacitī Germania onwards—I consider it likely that the heavy streams in this stanza and others represent such graves.

a seizer of the Moon in a troll’s \inx[C]{hame}.\footnoteB{The old hag raises the cubs of the wolf Fenrer, of which a particularly fierce one will swallow the moon. According to \Grimnismal\ 40 the sun is chased by a wolf called Skoll, while another wolf, Hate Rothswitner’s son, runs in front of her. This is elaborated upon in \Gylfaginning\ 12, where it is said that Skoll swallows the moon, while Hate swallows the sun. High then explains that “A lone troll-woman (\emph{gýgr}) lives to the east of Middenyard in that forest called Ironwood”, and “feeds the sons of many ettins, all in the likenesses of wolves, and thereof these wolves (i.e. Skoll and Hate) come. And it is also said that from that lineage a single one becomes the mightiest, and he is called \inx[P]{Moongarm}. He fills himself with the life of all those men who die and he swallows the moon and stains heaven and all the air with blood. Thereof the sun loses its rays and the winds are violent and moan hither and thither, and thus it says in the Spae of the Wallow: [...]” after which this and the following st. are quoted. This seems very much like a composite from several sources—probably \Voluspa\ 40–41 and \Grimnismal\ 40—but becomes contradictory when it states that two wolves swallow the moon.
Assuming that this is only a confusion on the part of the author of \Gylfaginning, this st. and the next must be describing Skoll, but it is of course not impossible that there was confusion about the exact details of these events among the Heathen poets. In favour of that seems to speak \Vafthrudnismal\ 46–47, where the sun is said to be swallowed by Fenrer (but see note there).}\evb\evg

{\small The following stanzas are paraphrased in \Gylfaginning\ ch. 53:

\begin{quote}
	\emph{Þá mę́lti Gangleri: „Hvárt lifa nǫkkur goðin þá, eða er þá nǫkkur jǫrð eða himinn?“ Hárr segir: „Upp skýtr jǫrðunni þá ór sę́num, ok er þá grǿn ok fǫgr. Vaxa þá akrar ó·sánir. Víðarr ok Váli lifa, svá at eigi hefir sę́rinn ok Surta-logi grandat þeim, ok byggja þeir á Iða-velli, þar sem fyrr var Ás-garðr, ok þar koma þá synir Þórs, Móði ok Magni, ok hafa þar Mjǫllni. Því nę́st koma þar Baldr ok Hǫðr frá Heljar, setjast þá allir samt, ok talast við, ok minnast á rúnar sínar, ok rǿða of tíðendi þau, er fyrrum hǫfðu verit, of Mið-garðs-orm ok um Fenris-úlf. Þá finna þeir í grasinu gull-tǫflur þę́r, er ę́sirnir hǫfðu átt. Svá er sagt:“}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	‘Then spoke Gangler: “Do any of the gods survive then, or is there any earth or heaven?” High says: “Then shoots the earth up from the seas, and is then green and fair. Then acres grow unsown. Wider and Wonnel live, as the sea and Surt’s flame has not wounded them, and they settle Idewolds, where Osyard once was, and there come the sons of Thunder, Mood and Main, and have there Millner. Thereafter come Balder and Hath from Hell, then all reconcile with each other and speak with each other and think back on their runes, and speak about the tidings which had once been: about the Middenyardswyrm and about the Fenrerswolf. Then they find in the grass those golden Tavel bricks which the Eese had owned. So it is said:”’
