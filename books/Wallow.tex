The \textbf{Spae of the Wallow} is the most comprehensive mythological text surviving from Heathen times.

The poem is attested in full in two independent recensions. The first is \Regius, where it is the first poem, found on folios 1r–3r. The second is \Hauksbok, where it is found at 20r–21r in the middle of a large collection of saws and Catholics works. Many verses are also cited in \Gylfaginning, large parts of which are directly based on the poem. Other verses are not attested directly, but are instead paraphrased. The paraphrases may still have critical value (so e.g. st. 19, where \emph{sal} in the parapharse corroborates \Hauksbok). For its constituent manuscripts see the General Introduction. %TODO: elaborate?

As seen from the title, the poem is a \inx[C]{spae} (\emph{spǫ́} ‘prophecy’) in the form of a monologue spoken by a \inx[C]{wallow} (\emph{vǫlva} ‘seeress, sibyl, prophetess’), summoned by Weden in order to relate mythological knowledge. The motif of Weden journeying to ask beings (whether ettins or wallows) is also seen in other sources. Closest is \Baldrsdraumar, wherein Weden summons a wallow out of her grave in \inx[L]{Hell} in order to understand why the god \inx[P]{Balder} is having ominous nightmares. There is also \Vafthrudnismal, wherein Weden challenges the wise ettin \inx[P]{Webthrithner} to a wisdom contest and defeats him. These journeys are also alluded to in \Harbardsljod\ 43–46.

In its being a mythic catalogue it also resembles the latter part of \Havamal, \Grimnismal, \Sigrdrifumal\ and \Allvismal, though it differs from them in a key way: it gives a (mostly?) complete chronological overview of the whole mythic timeline, from the creation to the end and rebirth of the world. That is not to say that the events are clearly described; they are related in a highly allusive fashion—certainly presupposing that the audience already be familiar with them. There may also be gaps and later inserts that make the poem more difficult.

The poem begins with a bid for silence (1), and the wallow recalling her earliest memories (2). She then recounts the ordering of the world by the gods (3–6) and the golden age of peace and plenty (7–8), which is, however, interrupted by the intrusion of three unidentified ettin-maidens (8, and see note there). After this follow two verses about the shaping of the dwarfs (9–10), and then several originally separate \emph{dwarf-tallies} (11–15), which are without doubt later inserts. Returning to the main narrative thread is described the creation and endowment of the first man and woman (16–17), Ugdrassle’s Ash (18), and the three \inx[G]{norns} living under it (19).

This is where the two full recensions of the poem diverge. Because of its older age and larger count of verses I have here followed the order of \Regius: the wallow recalls how a woman named Goldwey was sacrificed and reborn three times (20), and how she, under the name Heath, practiced sorcery and witchcraft (21). She then recalls the first war in the world, between the Ease and Wanes (22–23), and alludes to the slaying of the smith, who according to \Gylfaginning\ 42 was promised \inx[P]{Frow} and the sun and moon in exchange for building the wall of Osyard (24-25). This is followed by a cryptic verse describing Homedall’s hidden silence or hearing (26).

In \Hauksbok\ the structure is quite different. After the description of the norns (19), the Ease go to decide what action to take regarding the promising of Frow to the ettin (my 24-25), and Homedall’s hearing is described (26). Then follows the two verses about the old hag in Ironwood who raises the wolves that will swallow the sun and moon (40-41). After this come verses 20–23 in the same order as \Regius\ (see above).

To illustrate the differences between mss., and which verses are attested in which, I have prepared the following table showing the order of verses by manuscript, compared to the present edition. As most verses in \GylfMS\ are quoted on their own, and have little relation to the original order, these are simply marked with plus signs. When verses are quoted in a series, they are preceded by an alphabetically incrementing letter denoting which series they belong to. When there is a major difference in a ms. relative to the ed., such as in st. 10 where \GylfMS\ omits the first two lines, it is then marked with a star. The verses beginning with \emph{Þȧ gingu ręgin ǫll} ‘Then went the Reins all’ are represented by the following sentence.

According to \Gylfaginning\ 14 the dwarfs first originated as maggots in the corpse of Yimer, whose bones are described in \Grimnismal\ TODO and \Vafthrudnismal\ TODO as being used to make rocks. Dwarfs dwell in the rocks and earth; cf. for instance \Ynglingatal\ 2, where the Swedish king Swayther (\emph{Svęigðir} disappears into a rock in pursuit of a dwarf. More difficult to explain is the creation of dwarfs out of Yimer’s blood (which according to \Grimnismal\ TODO and \Vafthrudnismal\ TODO is the sea), since dwarfs are never said to dwell in water. — If one chooses the reading \emph{Bláinn} ‘Blown’ (named in the \inx[C]{thule}[thules] as a dwarf) instead of \emph{blǫ́um} ‘blue-black’, then following Gurevich (\emph{Skp} 2017, p. 693) one may see a kenning “the legs of Blown \name{dwarf} \ken{stone}”. Blown has otherwise been read as a poetic name for Yimer, but that is never attested elsewhere.}}\eva

Ash and Emble, \inx[C]{orlay}-less.\footnoteB{This verse is paraphrased in \Gylfaginning\ 9: \emph{Þá er þeir gengu með sę́varstrǫndu Borssynir, fundu þeir tré tvau ok tóku upp trén ok skǫpuðu af menn. Gaf inn fyrsti ǫnd ok líf, annarr vit ok hrę́ring, þriði ásjónu, mál ok heyrn ok sjón, gáfu þeim klę́ði ok nǫfn. Hét karlmaðrinn Askr, en konan Embla, ok ólst þaðan af mannkindin, sú er byggðin var gefinn undir Miðgarði.} ‘When the sons of Byre (cf. st. 4) walked along the sea-shore they found two trees and they took up the trees and shaped men from them. The first one gave breath (\emph{ǫnd}) and life, the second wit and movement, the third sight, speech, appearance and sight; they gave them clothes and names. The male was called Ash, and the woman Emble, and from them mankind was begotten, to whom were given the dwelling within Middenyard.’

The ON cognate of tree, \emph{tré}, can also mean ‘pieces of wood’, and it is traditionally seen as referring to pieces of driftwood. Yet as pointed out by \textcite{Hultgård2006} the comparative evidence suggests that the two were in fact living, growing trees (they would thus be part of the foliage described in st. 4) and there is nothing in the sources that speaks against this.

While Ash is easily identified with the same-named wood species (\emph{Fraxinus excelsior}), the etymology of Emble is much more difficult. The shaping of men from trees is used by poets in various kennings for men and women, especially in scoldic poetry (for a short discussion see \textciteshorttitle{SkP} I, p. lxxv ff.). While this is rarer in the Eddic corpus it does occur, e.g. in \Sigrdrifumal\ 4: \emph{brynþings apaldr} ‘apple-tree of the byrnie-\inx[C]{Thing} \ken{battle > warrior}’.}\evb

{\small Told allusively in 31–33 is the death of Balder at the hands of his blind brother Hath; it is elsewhere depicted with very similar language in \Baldrsdraumar\ 8–11, and described in detail in \Gylfaginning\ 49.

While the slaying of Balder is told in \Gylfaginning\ 49 and the revenge the gods took on Lock is told in \Gylfaginning\ 50, the slaying of Hath by his half-brother Wonnel is not elaborated on there. The brother-slaying may have been left out for moral reasons. He was not unknown to the author, as seen by \Gylfaginning\ 30, where he is said to be “the son of Weden and Rind”, “brave in battles and a very lucky shot”, and by \Skaldskaparmal\ 19, where relevant kennings for him are “son of Weden and Rind” and “revenge-os of Balder; the enemy of Hath and his bane”.

The revenge narrative is also dealt with by Saxo (III.4.1–8) in his typical euhemerized form (for Saxo’s Latin forms of relevant names see respective Encyclopedia entries): Weden learned from the Finnish wizard Horsethief that Rind, daughter of the Russian king,

This leaves the most explicit account of the revenge-narrative \Baldrsdraumar\ 11. TODO.

Weden (who could not murder his own son) seduced the woman Rind (in the by Cormac Awmundson’s TODO: \emph{sęið Yggr til rindar}), who gave birth to Wonnel.}

They turned Wonnel into a wolf (\emph{vargr}; note the double meaning) and had him tear apart his brother Narve, whose intestines were then taken and used to bind Lock so that he lay on top of three pointed stones; one digging into his shoulder-blades, one digging into his loins and one digging into his houghs. The intestine-bonds then turned into iron.

Since the author of \Gylfaginning\ knew \Voluspa, it is possible that he combined a text similar to \FraLoka\ with this st., interpreting \emph{Vála víg-bǫnd} as ‘Wonnel’s war-bonds’ and \emph{vargr} as ‘wolf’ rather than the more probable ‘outlaw’. Wonnel is otherwise only known as the son of Weden, and there is no reason why he could not also bound Lock. For further differences between them see \FraLoka.}\evb

In Anglo-Saxon and Nordic laws particularly severe crimes likt these ones made the committer a \inx[C]{nithing}, that is, one afflicted with \inx[C]{nithe} (severe shame). It is not surprising then that such nithings would be tortured by a creature named Nithehewer ‘Nithe-striker’. The practice of burying nithings (Tacitus: TODO) in bogs, flood-marks, or other unsettled ground is well attested in sources about Germanic culture from Tacitī Germania onwards—I consider it likely that the heavy streams in this stanza and in the two mentioned above represent such watery grounds. This is further elaborated on in \textcite{GermanicGems2}.}\evb

\bvb In the east\footnoteB{The cardinal direction associated with Ettinham, which is presumably where Ironwood is located.} dwells the old woman, in \inx[L]{Ironwood}, \\
and nourishes there the kindreds of \inx[P]{Fenrer} \ken{wolves}; \\
from them all comes one most particular: \\
a seizer of the moon, in the \inx[C]{hame} of a troll.\footnoteB{The old hag raises the cubs of the wolf Fenrer, of which a particularly fierce one will swallow the moon. According to \Grimnismal\ 40 the sun is chased by a wolf called Skoll, while another wolf, Hate Rothswitner’s son, runs in front of her. This is elaborated upon in \Gylfaginning\ 12, where it is said that Skoll swallows the moon, while Hate swallows the sun. High then explains that “A lone troll-woman (\emph{gýgr}) lives to the east of Middenyard in that forest called Ironwood”, and “feeds the sons of many ettins, all in the likenesses of wolves, and thereof these wolves (i.e. Skoll and Hate) come. And it is also said that from that lineage a single one becomes the mightiest, and he is called \inx[P]{Moongarm}. He fills himself with the life of all those men who die and he swallows the moon and stains heaven and all the air with blood. Thereof the sun loses its rays and the winds are violent and moan hither and thither, and thus it says in the Spae of the Wallow: [...]” after which this and the following st. are quoted. This seems very much like a composite from several sources—probably \Voluspa\ 40–41 and \Grimnismal\ 40—but becomes contradictory when it states that two wolves swallow the moon.
Assuming that this is only a confusion on the part of the author of \Gylfaginning, this st. and the next must be describing Skoll, but it is of course not impossible that there was confusion about the exact details of these events among the Heathen poets. In favour of that seems to speak \Vafthrudnismal\ 46–47, where the sun is said to be swallowed by Fenrer (but see note there).}\evb

\bvb Then comes \inx[P]{Line}’s second sorrow to pass,\footnoteB{That the first sorrow was the death of Balder (see sts. 31–33) is unanimously understood.

In spite of this, almost all translators and commentors have understood Line as here referring to Frie, or questioned whether her existence as a separate goddess is not a misunderstanding on the part of the author of \Gylfaginning. \textcite{Hopkins2017} argues excellently that this need not be the case; as a subordinate goddess of Frie, Line’s two sorrows would be her failing to protect Balder and Weden (the son and husband of her mistress, respectively) from harm.} \\

{\small The following stanzas are paraphrased in \Gylfaginning\ ch. 53:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Þá mę́lti Gangleri: „Hvárt lifa nǫkkur goðin þá, eða er þá nǫkkur jǫrð eða himinn?“ Hárr segir: „Upp skýtr jǫrðunni þá ór sę́num, ok er þá grǿn ok fǫgr. Vaxa þá akrar ó-sánir. Víðarr ok Váli lifa, svá at eigi hefir sę́rinn ok Surta-logi grandat þeim, ok byggja þeir á Iða-velli, þar sem fyrr var Ás-garðr, ok þar koma þá synir Þórs, Móði ok Magni, ok hafa þar Mjǫllni. Því nę́st koma þar Baldr ok Hǫðr frá Heljar, setjast þá allir samt, ok talast við, ok minnast á rúnar sínar, ok rǿða of tíðendi þau, er fyrrum hǫfðu verit, of Miðgarðs-orm ok um Fenris-úlf. Þá finna þeir í grasinu gull-tǫflur þę́r, er ę́sirnir hǫfðu átt. Svá er sagt:“}

‘Then spoke Gangler: “Do any of the gods survive then, or is there any earth or heaven?” High says: “Then shoots the earth up from the seas, and is then green and fair. Then acres grow unsown. Wider and Wonnel live, as the sea and Surt’s flame has not wounded them, and they settle Idewold, where Osyard once was, and there come the sons of Thunder, Mood and Main, and have there Millner. Thereafter come Balder and Hath from Hell, then all reconcile with each other and speak with each other and think back on their runes, and speak about the tidings which had once been: about the Middenyardsworm and about the Fenrerswolf. Then they find in the grass those golden Tavel bricks which the Ease had owned. So it is said:”’
