\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Speeches of Grimner} (\textlink{Grimnismal}) are preserved whole in both \Regius\ and \AM.

\subsection{Structure}

\textlink{Grimnismal} essentially consists of several nested layers.  The outermost layer is the prose passages which bracket the actual poem (P1–P2).  It is hard to say for how long these have accompanied the verses, but since they are found in both \Regius\ and \AM\ they must go back to a now-lost manuscript archetype.  The second layer is sts. 1–3 and 53–55, which together with the prose form a narrative frame for the gnomic wisdom stanzas which make up the bulk of the poem and its core.  These gnomic stanzas are mythological and sometimes obscure, and align closely with other Eddic wisdom verse like \textlink{Havamal}, \textlink{Vafthrudnismal}, \textlink{Sigrdrifumal}, and \textlink{Alvissmal}.

\subsection{Summary}
The text begins with the frame narrative, which tells the story of the two king’s sons Ayner and Garfrith.  Ayner is fostered by Frie, while the two winters younger Garfrith is fostered by her husband Weden himself.  After their father’s death it is Garfrith who becomes king, following his betrayal of his elder brother. (P1)  One day Weden and Frie are arguing over their respective foster-sons, and Frie accusses Garfrith of torturing wayfaring guests.  Weden sets out to test the hospitality of his protégé, but unbeknownst to him, his wife has already sent her handmaid in disguise to warn Garfrith about the coming of an evil wizard.  When Weden arrives he is thus promptly captured and placed between two fires so that he will reveal his name.  Garfrith’s young son, Ayner (clearly named after his uncle), kindly approaches the god and offers him a horn of drink.  Grimner drinks from it, and here the poem proper begins. (P2)

Weden begins by complaining about the fires which are now burning his cloak (1); he states that for eight nights not a soul has offered him any help save Ayner, Garfrith’s son, who will soon become king after his father (2).  As thanks for the drink he gives him good health, and will offer him holy knowledge (3).

Here the gnomic section begins as Weden lists the individual abodes of the gods (4–17).  The locations are numbered, but a few facts speak to these numbers being a later insert:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The alliteration is never reliant on the numbers; if one compares the numbered questions in \textlink{Vafthrudnismal} 20–42 the difference is striking.
  \item The numbering is inconsistent; Thunder’s realm (st. 4) is not counted, and Wider’s land (st. 17) has no numeral (perhaps since the form of the stanza would not allow it.)
  \item In sts. 11–15 cited in \Gylfaginning, the numbers are missing.
\end{enumerate}

%This section has been discussed in detail by \textcite{deVries1952} TODO! who considers it corrupt. Specifically, he sees the second half of v. 4 as a later insert, since it does not elaborate on the “holy land” mentioned in the first half. \textcite{Jackson1995} argues convincingly against this, showing how the first half serves as a generalized introduction to the list; the holy land is the dwelling-places of the gods.)

After this list come several sts. relating to Weden and his hall, Walhall (18–23). Mentioned are the preparation of food in Walhall (18), Weden’s wolves (19) and ravens (20), the river through which the dead have to wade (21) and the gate through which they have to pass (22), the count of doors in Walhall (23), the count of doors in Thunder’s hall Bilshirner (24), and two animals which stand on the hall and gnaw on the branches of the tree Leered (25–26). From the latter animal’s—the stag Oakthirner’s—horns droplets fall into Wharyelmer, which is the origin of all rivers (26).

This introduces a list of mythic rivers (27–28), ending with the waters through which Thunder must wade on his way to Ugdrassle (29). This leads to a list of the horses ridden by the other gods on their way to Ugdrassle (31) which is followed by a description of the roots of Ugdrassle (31), then its animals (32–36) the Walkirries (37), and beings associated with the sun and moon (38–40), the things created from Yimer’s body (41–42) with a digression on the significance of the \inx[P]{bloot} for men in the present (43, see note there!), the creation of the ship Shidebladner (44) and finally a list of the noblest of several categories of things and groups (45).

After these lists Weden utters an unclear st. invoking the gods (46), before listing his many names in which they were used (47–50).  He then turns to Garfrith, disappointed by the inhospitality and poor conduct of his former protégé, and foresees his imminent death (51–53).  He finally reveals himself by his true name, daring Garfrith to face him (53).  After this he repeats several of his names (54), and the poem ends.

In the concluding prose section we are told that Garfrith, after learning that he was torturing Weden, hurried up to take the god away from the fires, but tripped and fell on his sword and died.  After this his son Ayner ruled for a long time (P4).

\section{From the sons of king Reading (\emph{Frá sonum Hrauðungs konungs})}

Hrauðungr konungr átti tvá sonu. Hét annarr Agnarr, en annarr Geir·røðr.
Agnarr var tíu vetra en Geir·røðr átta vetra. Þeir reru tveir á báti með dorgar sínar at smá-fiski.
Vindr rak þá í haf út. Í nǫ́tt-myrkri brutu þeir við land ok gingu upp; fundu \edtrans{kot-bónda einn}{a lone cottage farmer}{\Bfootnote{The farmer and his wife were Weden and Frie as is clarified by the following prose.}}.
Þar vǫ́ru þeir um vetrinn.  Kerling fostraði Agnar, \edtrans{en karl Geir·røð}{and the farmer Garfrith}{\Bfootnote{The motif of Weden favouring the youngest brother is also found in \textlink{Rigsthula}.}}.

Þeir fengu byr ok kvǫ́mu til stǫðva fǫður síns. Geir·røðr var fram í skipi.
Hann hljóp upp á land en hratt út skipinu, ok mę́lti: „Far þú þar er smyl hafi þik.“
Skipit rak út. En Geir·røðr gekk út til bǿjar; hǫ́num var vel fagnat; þá var faðir hans andaðr.
Var þá Geir·røðr til konungs tekinn, ok varð maðr á-gę́tr.\epa

\bpb {\huge K}ing Reading had two sons. One was called Ayner and the other Garfrith.
Ayner was ten winters old, but Garfrith eight winters. The two were rowing in a boat with their trolling-lines for small fishing.
The wind drove them out into the sea. In the dark of night they crashed onto land and walked ashore; they found a lone cottage farmer.
There they stayed over the winter. The farmer’s wife fostered Ayner and the farmer Garfrith.
In the spring the husband gave them ships, but when he and his wife led them to the shore, the husband spoke privately with Garfrith.
They caught good wind, and came to their father’s harbour. Garfrith was in the front of the ship.
He leapt onto land and pushed out the ship, and spoke: ”Go thou whither the fiends may have thee!”
The ship drove out. But Garfrith walked towards the farm; he was welcomed well; by then was his father ended.
Garfrith was then taken as king, and became an excellent man.\epb\epg

\bpb Weden and Frie sat in the \inx[L]{Lithshelf} and looked about all the Homes.\footnoteB{Very similar to the Longbeard Origin Myth (TODO: reference and elaborate).}
Weden spoke: “Dost thou see Ayner, thy foster-son, where he begets children with a troll-woman in her cave?\footnoteB{This may relate to Frie’s role as love-goddess. Ayner is in any case to be understood as a weak, effeminate man.}
But Garfrith, \emph{my} foster-son, is king and now rules his land.”
Frie says: “He is such a meat-nithing that he torments his guests if he thinks too many are coming!”
Weden says that this is the greatest lie; they make a wager over this matter.
Frie sent her handmaid, Full, to Garfrith’s hall. She bade the king be wary, lest he be destroyed by the \inx[C]{many-cunning} man who had come to his land; and said that his mark was that no hound was so fierce that it would rush at him.
But it was the greatest falsehood that Garfrith was not \inx[C]{good of meat}; and yet he has that man bound whom the hounds would not touch.
He was in a blue cloak and called himself Grimner, and did not tell anything more about himself, even though he was asked.
The king had him tortured that he would speak, and set him between two fires; and he sat there for eight nights.
King Garfrith had a son ten winters old, and he was called Ayner after his brother.
Ayner went up to Grimner and gave him a full horn to drink, saying that the king did badly as he had him tortured without cause.
Grimner drank it up. Then the fire had grown so much that the cloak burned on Grimner. He quoth:\epb\epg\stepcounter{prosea}

\section{The Speeches of Grimner}

\bvg\bva\mssnote{\Regius~9r/27, \AM~4r/17}%
„\alst{H}ęitr est \alst{h}ripuðr \hld\ ok \alst{h}ęldr til mikill, &
\ind \edtrans{gǫng·umk \alst{f}irr}{go far from me}{\Bfootnote{Equivalent to \emph{gakk mér firr}.  The word \emph{gǫng·umk} ‘go \dots\ from me’ merits some linguistic discussion on the form of the imperative (\emph{gang-} rather than \emph{gakk}) and the suffixed pronoun \emph{-umk}.  The normal 2sg imper. of ON \emph{ganga} ‘to go’ is \emph{gakk}, which goes back to a sound change in PN whereby word-final homorganic clusters were devoiced, and in the case of clusters of the form \textipa{/\*N\*C/} assimilated into \textipa{/\r*{\*C}\textlengthmark/}.
Thus PN \emph{*gang} ‘go!’ (cf. Got. \emph{gagg} \textipa{/gaNg/}, OHG \emph{gang}) > \emph{*gank} > \emph{gakk}, also \emph{*stand} ‘stand!’ > \emph{statt}, \emph{*bind} ‘bind!’ > \emph{bitt}.  This sound change was only active in early PN, and only affected those clusters which were word-final before syncope of unstressed vowels; thus in the ON 1sg pres. ind. \emph{ek gęng, ek stęnd} (< \emph{*ek gangu, ek standu}) ‘I go, I stand’ et c. we find the original cluster preserved.

At some time in early PN, accusative personal pronouns were suffixed to certain verbs; those which survive into ON are 1sg \emph{-umk} (= ON \emph{mik}) and 3sg reflexive \emph{-sk} (= ON \emph{sik}).  In later ON these clitics became the passive endings still found in modern North Germanic, but in archaic or poetic ON they could still serve as suffixed pronouns with a reflexive or even dative function, as is the case in this instance.  The fact that the suffixion of the pronoun has prevented assimilation of the consonant cluster \emph{ng} establishes its \emph{terminus ante quem} as the first syncope period, the early 7th century, and since it is unlikely that such an irregular form as \emph{gǫng·umk} could have survived for long alongside \emph{gakk}, its presence here probably allows us to conclude that \textlink{Grimnismal} is a rather old poem.

Other instances of dative \emph{-umk} include \textlink{Lokasenna} 35/1a: \emph{es·umk}, \textlink{Fafnismal} 1/4: \emph{stǫnd·umk}, Fragment from Snorre’s Edda 2, st. 1/1: \emph{eru·mk}, and \Ragnarsdrapa\ 7/2a: \emph{gǫf·umk}.}} \alst{f}uni! &

To my knowledge this sense is never otherwise attested, and its common meaning is ‘defraud, trick, betray’.  A simpler reading would be to see this as a reference to the myth of the Ettin-smith who built the wall of Osyard.  The Gods had promised him Sun, Moon, and Frow, if he could build it in a year, but employed various tricks to hinder him.  When it at last looked like he would make it in time, Thunder slew him.

\bvb Folkwong is (the ninth), and there Frow decides \\
\ind the choice of seats in the hall; \\
half the slain she chooses each day, \\
\ind but half does Weden own.\footnoteB{This st. is cited and closely paraphrased in \Gylfaginning\ 24. — The roots of \emph{kjósa val} ‘choose the slain’ are the same as those in \inx[C]{walkirrie} (\emph{val-kyrja} ‘chooser of the slain’), and as Frow is a prominent goddess this would surely make her the chief walkirrie.
This is paralleled by \Sorlathattr, where Frow assumes the name \inx[C]{Gandle} (\emph{Gǫndul}, a name attested in several lists of walkirries; see \textlink{Voluspa} 30 and Notes) and incites the legendary never-ending Conflict of the Headnings (\emph{Hjaðningavíg}).
In spite of this parallel, there are good reasons to believe that the chief walkirrie was \inx[C]{Frie}, Weden’s wife.
First, one of the functions of the Walkirries is to bear ale to the Oneharriers (\textlink{Grimnismal} 37). This mirrors royal Germanic banquets attested in heroic poetry, where the host’s wife or daughter would pour ale to his retainers and guests (the so-called ‘lady with a mead cup’ ritual; see \textcite{Enright1996} and \textcite{Riseley2014}). As Weden’s wife, we would expect Frie to have this role.
Second, at Balder’s funeral as attested in \Gylfaginning\ (TODO. chapter number), Weden rides with Frie and the Walkirries, while Frow rides alone with her cats. If she were chief walkirrie, it is rather strange that she should not ride with them.
Third, there are two separate myths where Frie and Weden contend over the fates of armies and men. These are the prose introduction to the present poem and the Longbeard origin myth (for which see Introduction to the present poem).}\evb\evg

The conception of the sun pulled by a horse-driven chariot is attested going back to the Bronze Age.  A notable instance from the Germanic cultural area is the Trundholm sun chariot, a cultic object found on Zealand, Denmark belonging to the Nordic Bronze Age (\char`~\ 1400 BC), which may also depict horses pulling the Day and Night; see \hyperref[Vafthrudnismal:11]{\textlink{Vafthrudnismal} 11–14} and Figures \ref{fig:trundholm-front}, \ref{fig:trundholm-back}.

\Ballnote{This st. is one of the most difficult in the poem and many interpretations have been made.  The traditional view (e.g. \textcite{FinnurEdda}, Bellows, Sijmons and Gering (p. 208)) relates it to the poem’s frame narrative.  Weden, bound between the two fires, cryptically asks for a cauldron hanging above him from the roof to be moved aside so that the Gods will be able to see him through the smoke-vent and rescue him.  This explanation leaves very much unexplained, namely the stanza’s placement in the gnomic wisdom section of the poem (unless the whole section is taken to be a later insert—so Finnur—, for which there is no textual support), the invocation of the obscure god Woulder, the lack of mention of a cauldron elsewhere in the poem, and the big question of why the gods would bestow their grace unto the person who first set the fire which is presently torturing Weden.

I find the interpretation of \textcite{Nordberg2005} more convincing.  He argues that the st. is another piece of gnomic wisdom, referring to the cooking of the sacrificial meal in large cauldrons during the \inx[C]{bloot}.  This has textual support, e.g. \HakonarSaga\ 14, describing the traditional bloot in the Throndlaw (\emph{Þrǿnda-lǫg}), Norway: \emph{At veizlu þeiri skyldu allir menn ǫl eiga; þar var ok drepinn alls konar smali ok svá hross, [...] en slátr skyldi sjóða til mann-fagnaðar; eldar skyldu vera á miðju gólfi í hofinu ok þar katlar yfir.} ‘At that gathering all men were to have ale; thereat were also slain all kinds of small cattle and likewise horses, [...] and the fresh meat was to be be cooked for men to enjoy.  There were to be fires in the middle of the floor in the hove and kettles above them.’  According to this view, the stanza is speaking of the Heavenly favour (\emph{hylli}) earned by the ritualist who sets the cooking fire, since that act enables the Gods to become guests at the ritual meal.

Nordberg’s interpretation is especially interesting when one considers the immediately preceding stanzas 41–42 which describe the ordering of the world by the Gods through the sacrifice and dismembering of Yimer, the primordial victim.  (That the slaying of Yimer was in fact a sacrifice is supported by the manner in which it was done, viz. beheading, which was the typical manner of slaying sacrificial bulls in the Wiking Age; see note to \textlink{Vafthrudnismal} 21/4.)  In other Indo-European religions—most famously the Vedic \emph{Púruṣa}, \Rigveda\ 10.90—the first sacrifice of a Great Being serves as the model for all future sacrifice, the performance of which reenacts the creation and enables the continued existence of the world and the social order \parencite{Lincoln1986}, and the sequence \textlink{Grimnismal} 41–43 would then attest this also in the Germanic tradition.   For the role of fire in Germanic and Vedic sacrifice see \textcite{Kaliff2005}.}%

It cannot be simply for the sake of alliteration, since \emph{Óðins} ‘Weden’s’ would work just as well.
