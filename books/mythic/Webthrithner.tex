\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Speeches of Webthrithner} (\textlink{Vafthrudnismal}) are found in full in \Regius; the latter half (from st. 20 onwards) in \AM.  Several stanzas are also cited in \Gylfaginning.

\subsection{Structure}

The poem essentially consists of a riddle contest between the god Weden and the ettin Webthrithner.  Far from being a loose collection of mythic lore, it has a tight structure and logical plan throughout.  The whole may be divided into 4 sections, first the prologue, where Weden takes counsel from his wife Frie and sets out for Webthrithner’s hall (sts. 1–10).  The remaining 3 sections form the contest, and consist of alternating stanzas where one part asks and the other answers.  They are distinguished from each other by means of repeated refrains in the question stanzas, and consist of Webthrithner’s 4 unnumbered questions (11–19), Weden’s 12 numbered questions (20–43), and Weden’s 6 unnumbered questions about the end times (44–55).

The following table illustrates the refrains; for stanza 40 see note there:

\begin{small}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c c|}
  \hline
  11–17 & \emph{Sęg mér/þat, Gagn·ráðr, \hld\ alls ȧ golfi vill / þïns of fręista frama} \\
  20–42 & \emph{Sęg þat (hit) \emph{N}(:a) \hld\ ... / ... Vaf·þrúðnir vitir} \\
  44–54 & \emph{Fjǫlð ek fór, \hld\ fjǫlð fręistaða’k, / fjǫlð ek ręynda ręgin} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{small}

Something must be said on the numerology of the questions—it is hardly a coincidence that Weden asks exactly 18 questions, this being a multiple of the sacred number 9.  It is notable that another Odinic list, Leed-tally (sts. 147–165) of \textlink{Havamal}, also has 18 items, especially that the 18th spell there, like the 18th question here, is a mystery known only to Weden himself.

\subsection{Summary}

Weden asks his wife, Frie, for counsel, as he is curious about the ancient wisdom which the ettin Webthrithner might possess (1). Frie expresses worry, since she considers Webthrithner stronger than all other ettins (2), but Weden says that he has travelled far and wide, and wishes to know what Webthrithner’s hall is like (3).  Frie wishes him good luck against the ettin (4) and he departs, to challenge Webthrithner’s \emph{orð-spęki} ‘word-wisdom’ (5). He arrives at the ettin’s hall and introduces himself (6); Webthrithner promptly declares that Weden will not come out of the hall unless he be wiser than him (7).  Weden introduces himself as Gainred, saying that he has travelled far in need of Webthrithner’s hospitality (8).  Webthrithner invites Gainred to sit down (9), who in turn utters a gnomic stanza (10) not unlike those of the first section of \textlink{Havamal}.

Webthrithner begins by asking four mythological questions, each answered by Gainred in turn. The questions concern the horse that pulls the Day (11–12) and the one that pulls the Night (13–14), the river which divides the gods and ettins (15–16), and the plain where \inx[P]{Surt} and the gods will fight (17–18).

Webthrithner calls the guest learned and invites him to sit.  He declares that the loser of the contest must give his head (19).  The roles are now reversed, and Gainred poses twelve numbered questions to the ettin.  He asks about the origins of earth and heaven (20–21), of sun and moon (22–23), of day, night, and the phases of the moon (24–25), and of winter and summer (26–27); then about the earliest being, namely the ettin \inx[P]{Earyelmer} (28–29), his origins (30–31) and how he reproduced asexually (32–33). Gainred continues by asking what Webthrithner himself first remembers (34–35), about the origin of the wind (36–37), the god \inx[P]{Nearth} (38–39), Walhall and the Oneharriers (40–41), and where Webthrithner has learned all this wisdom (42–43).

The tone of the questions now changes, and Gainred asks six questions concerning the end times, all beginning with the same refrain.  He asks which humans will survive after the \inx[L]{Fimblewinter} (44–45), how the sun can rise after Fenrer has destroyed it (46–47), about some obscure maidens (48–49; see there), which Eese will survive after the flame of Surt goes out (50–51), and how Weden will die (52–53).  Finally, he asks the unknowable question: what did Weden speak in the ear of Balder before he was burned on the pyre? (54)

Webthrithner at last understands the identity of his challenger, since only Weden himself could know the answer to that question.  He laconically accepts his imminent death and the futility of his own wisdom; the poem ends with his admission that Weden will always be the wisest (55).

\Ballnote{Sts. 11–14 deal with the two horses that pull the Day and Night around the heavens.  Their origin is discussed in \Gylfaginning\ 10: \emph{Nǫrfi eða Narfi hét jǫtunn, er byggði í Jǫtun-heimum.  Hann átti dóttur, er Nótt hét.  Hon var svǫrt ok døkk, sem hon átti ę́tt til.  Hon var gipt þeim manni, er Nagl·fari hét; þeira sonr hét Auðr.  Því nę́st var hon gipt þeim, er Ánarr hét; Jǫrð hét þeira dóttir.  Síðast átti hana Dellingr, ok var hann ása ę́ttar; var þeira sonr Dagr; var hann ljóss ok fagr eftir faðerni sínu.  Þá tók Al·fǫðr Nótt ok Dag, son hennar, ok gaf þeim tvá hesta ok tvę́r kerrur ok sendi þau upp á himin, at þau skulu ríða á hverjum tveim dǿgrum um·hverfis jǫrð’ina.  Ríðr Nótt fyrri þeim hesti, er kallaðr er Hrím·faxi, ok at morgni hverjum dǫggvir hann jǫrð’ina af mél-dropum sínum.  Sá hestr, er Dagr á, heitir Skin·faxi, ok lýsir allt lopt ok jǫrð’ina af faxi hans.} ‘Narrow or Narve was the name of an ettin who dwelled in the Ettinhomes.  He had a daughter whose name was night.  She was black and dark like her lineage bespoke.  She was married off to the man whose name was Nailfarer.  Their son was Ead.  Thereafter she was married off to the one whose name was Oner.  Earth was the name of their daughter.  Lastly Delling got her, and he was of the lineage of the Eese.  Their son was Day; he was bright and fair after his father’s side.  Then Allfather took Night, and Day her son, and gave them two horses and two chariots and sent them up onto the heaven that they should ride every two half-days a full circle around the earth.  Night rides in front on the horse which is called Rimefax, and every morning he bedews the earth with the drool from his bit.  The horse owned by Day is named Shinefax, and all the air and the earth is lit up by his mane.’

They are mentioned again in \Skaldskaparmal\ 72, which deals with legendary horses: \emph{Ár·vakr ok Al·sviðr draga sól’ina, sem fyrr er ritat. Hrím·faxi eða Fjǫr·svartnir draga nótt’ina. Skin·faxi eða Glaðr fylgja degi’num.} ‘Yorewaker and Allswith pull the sun as is written earlier.  Rimefax or Ferrowswartner pulls the night.  Shinefax or Glad follows the day.’   For Yorewaker and Allswith see \textlink{Grimnismal}[38].  The alternative names Ferrowswartner (‘Life-darkener’) and Glad probably derive from now-lost poetic sources.

The motif of horses, especially mounted on chariots, pulling the heavenly bodies or day and night is very ancient and attested as far back as the Bronze Age.  It is frequent in the hymns of \Rigveda\ and Greek texts and is found depicted archeologically on the beautiful Trundholm Sun Chariot from Denmark of the Nordic Bronze Age, the cultural and ethnic ancestors to the Germanic peoples.

Cf. \Sonatorrek\ 3/3: \emph{jǫtuns hals \hld\ undir þjóta} ‘the neck-wounds of the ettin \ken{seas} roar’, which attests that Yimer was slain by decapitation, the typical way of wasting beasts of sacrifice (so e.g. \textlink{Hymiskvida}[15]).  That this is not a mere literary construct is proven by the excavation of the Wiking Age Hove-steads (\emph{Hofstaðir}) on Iceland, where bulls were seasonally slain in what was undoubtedly ritual sacrifice: “The most likely reconstruction from the forensics of the skulls requires at least a two-person team, one of whom struck the animal between the eyes (effectively killing it and certainly stunning it into momentary immobility) while the second swung a fairly broad-bladed axe at the neck or base of the skull for a beheading stroke.”  After the slaying (and presumed feasting on the meat), their skulls were displayed for a prolonged period of time (\citeauthor{Gavin2007}, \citeyear{Gavin2007}, p. 23).  \citeauthor{Gavin2007} note that this was not the usual manner of slaughtering animals on Iceland, and even has practical downsides compared to a slower cutting of the throat, like splintered bones and damage to the cutting blade.  On the other hand, the swift beheading and flow of blood would have great dramatic effect, and, what the authors neglect to mention, clearly reenact the slaying of Yimer: the separation of the skull (heaven) from the body (earth), and the great flow of blood (sea-water) from the neck-wound, lastly the burial of the body in the earth, and the display of the skull on high to symbolize the heaven.}}.“%NOTE: this is a hack for parencite which for whatever reason doesn't work inside a Bfootnote with multiple authors. reledmac...

\Ballnote{Over æons the splashing venom-droplets of the Ilewaves combined until they formed a sentient being.  This was Earyelmer, whom \Gylfaginning\ identifies with \inx[P]{Yimer}.  In \Gylfaginning\ 5 Snorre cites this stanza and the latter half of st. 30 in support of his lengthy and embellished creation narrative, but it is not certain that is what the older poet had in mind.

The Ilewaves are probably a reflex of the chaotic primeval Waters found in many West Eurasian mythologies, including \emph{Genesis} 1:1–3 and \Rigveda\ 10.129.  Of these two foundational religious sources the latter is closer to the present stanza, and probably holds the more archaic conception.  Where we in the Jewish narrative find a \emph{creation out of nothing}—at the very beginning of time God’s spirit is on the Waters and He makes the light shine over them—we instead find in these two Indo-European texts a \emph{spontaneous emergence} of a single primeval entity long before the Gods are born—here from the violent splashing of venom, in \Rigveda\ 10.129.3 from “the power of heat” (OI \emph{tápasas mahinā́}).
This entity in turn asexually begets sexual beings—here through rubbing his limbs together, in \Rigveda\ 10.129.4 simply giving rise to “desire” (\emph{kā́ma}) which serves as the “primal seed of thought” (\emph{mánasas rḗtas pratʰamám})—and it is from these that the world is populated by the raw matter out of which the Gods eventually create (or \emph{shape}) the World as we know it through sacrifice (see st. 21 above, \textlink{Voluspa}[3]–4, \textlink{Grimnismal}[41]–42).}%

This is clearly a variant of the Great Flood or Deluge myth.  It may have been found even among the Scandinavians, but it may also be Snorre’s invention based on the Bible, in which case the present stanza was about as obscure to him as it is to us.

In Old Norse prose \emph{lúðr} usually means ‘trumpet, blowing horn’, less commonly ‘flour-bin’; the underlying sense seems to be ‘hollowed-out wood’, which is why it is presently translated as “canoe”.  Considering the transitive nature of Bareyelmer being laid (\emph{of lagiðr}) upon it, the stanza could be read as speaking of a ship burial, so that the first thing Webthrithner remembers is Bareyelmer’s funeral.}}“\eva

\Ballnote{This question-stanza is malformed in both \Regius\ and \AM\ and thus has to be partly reconstructed on the basis of st. 41.  The ms. preservation of 40–41 is as follows:

All four mss. of \Gylfaginning\ attest st. 41 with no textual variants.  \Regius\ has one complete stanza, which is clearly a mix between the question and the answer: \emph{Sęg-ðu þat hit ęllipta, hvar ýtar tu̇num ï hǫggva⸗sk hvęrjan dag? Val þęir kjósa ok ríða vígi frȧ sitja męirr of sáttir saman.} (normalised.)  \AM\ has only the very beginning of st. 40 (“Tell this eleventh”), followed by the full st. 41: \emph{Sęg þat hit ęllipta allir ęins hęrjar Óðins tu̇num ï hǫggva⸗sk hvęrjan dag. Val þęir kjósa ok ríða vígi frȧ sitja męirr of sáttir saman.} (norm.)  Although \Regius\ has a complete question-stanza it stands out by lacking a refrain in the first two lines, something found in all other questions in the poem (see Introduction); it also has no corresponding answer-stanza.

In order to restore stanza 40, the following conjectural reconstruction has been undertaken in the pres. ed.: in lines 1a–2 the refrain \emph{ef þïtt ǿði dugir ok þú Vaf·þrúðnir vitir} ‘if thy wisdom avails, and thou, Webthrithner, oughtst to know,’ has been inserted from sts. 20 and 22, which also have ordinal numbers alliterating with vowels; in line 3a the word \emph{allir} ‘all’ has been inserted from 41 to get vowel-alliteration with \emph{ýtar}.}%

Depending on the age of the cpd. the first element may either reflect the semantics of PIE \emph{albʰós} ‘white’ (whence Latin \emph{albus} ‘id.’) or ON \emph{alfr} ‘elf’—that is not to say that it goes back to PIE, but only that the sense “white” must have existed at some point in Germanic prehistory.
The second element \emph{rǫðull} is not the normal ON word for “wheel” (\emph{hjól}) but is instead inherited from PGmc. \emph{*radulaz} (\char`~\ \emph{*raduraz}, whence OE \emph{rǫdor} ‘heaven, sky’, OS \emph{radur, radul} ‘id.’)
It is composed of \emph{*raþą} ‘wheel’ (> German \emph{Rad} ‘id.’) with the nominal suffix \emph{*-ulaz} \char`~\ \emph{*-uraz} ‘(habitually) doing’ and thus means something like ‘circler, turner, revolver’; the PIE root of the former is \emph{*Hreth₂-} (whence also Latin \emph{rota} ‘wheel’, Sanskrit \emph{rátʰa} ‘chariot’, \cite[405]{Kroonen2013}).
