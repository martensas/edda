\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Lay of Hymer} (\textlink{Hymiskvida}) is attested in both \Regius\ and \AM.  The two mss. agree very well with each other; they share the same stanzas in the same order.  The most substantial difference is the title; \AM\ has \emph{Hymis kviða} ‘the lay of Hymer’ while \Regius\ instead has \emph{Þórr dró Miðgarðs-orm} ‘Thunder pulled the Middenyardswyrm’.

\subsection{Content}

\textlink{Hymiskvida} belongs to a genre of comedic stories about Thunder’s adventures in Ettinland.  These stories all see Thunder set out from Osyard followed by one or more companions.  Together the party undergoes various fantastical tests and hardships on their way through the Ettinhomes, and return home after Thunder has slaughtered yet another Ettin clan.  The popularity of this genre is seen by the large number of stories belonging to it.  In the Poetic Edda is also represented by \textlink{Thrymskvida} and to some extent \textlink{Harbardsljod}.  Other examples are Thunder’s journey to Outyards-Lock in \Gylfaginning\ 44–47, his fight with Thedse in \Skaldskaparmal\ 2–3 and \Haustlong\ 2–13, his fight with Rungner in \Skaldskaparmal\ 24 and \Haustlong\ 14–20, and his journey to Garfrith in \Skaldskaparmal\ 26 (in which two sts. are cited; see \textlink{EddicFragments}[F6][6]).

\subsubsection{The otherness of the Ettins}

The Ettins are very much an \emph{other} to the Gods, and this is something which \textlink{Hymiskvida} strongly emphasizes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item They live in the far east (st. 5) in an inhospitable, frozen climate (st. 10) of mountains (sts. 2, 17) and lavafields (sts. 36, 38);
  \item they are physically deviant: misshapen (st. 10), grey-haired (st. 16), many-headed (sts. 8, 35), having heads harder than stone (sts. 30–31);
  \item they are likened to apes (st. 20), whales (st. 36) and Danes (st. 17, see note!);
  \item they are stingy and inhospitable (sts. 9, 16);
  \item they are snide and cowardly (sts. 19–20, 25–26, 28–32).
\end{itemize}

In general the Ettins stand in direct opposition to the Old Germanic social norms, as represented by the Gods; \emph{they} live in a lush green land and are young, beautiful, generous, and brave.  The one exception in the poem is Tew’s mother in st. 8, who is blonde, beautiful, and hospitable; the mother of a god must also be godlike.

As natural inferiors and a threat to the social order the Ettins must be subjugated by the Gods, and the agent of this is Thunder.  Throughout the poem he constantly humiliaties the ettins Eagre and Hymer, recurringly through completing their challenges, which follow a similar scheme: Thunder is given a dangerous or near-impossible test of strength, but quickly accomplishes it through a combination of brawn and brain, humiliating the challenger.  The challenges consist of finding an enormously large kettle (st. 3, explicitly called Eagre’s “revenge”), wrestling one of Hymer’s oxen for bait (sts. 17–18), carrying home Hymer’s whales and boat (st. 26), breaking Hymer’s finest chalice (st. 28), and perhaps also taking away the cauldron (st. 33)—though that may just be Hymer wishing to finally be rid of the pestering gods.

In the end Thunder delivers justice by slaughtering Hymer and his troop of many-headed Ettins, probably his clansmen.

\subsubsection{The fishing expedition}

At the center of the poem stands Thunder’s famous fishing expedition; the god gets the Middenyardswyrm on the hook but ultimately fails to catch it.  In this section, especially in sts. 22–24, one finds a more reverent tone than elsewhere in the poem.

This myth was very popular in the Wiking Age and is dealt with in five fragmentary Scaldic poems from the 9th or 10th centuries.  These are all found in quotations in \Skaldskaparmal; they are (by their \Skp\ 3 sigla) Bragi \emph{Þórr}, ÚlfrU \emph{Húsdr} 3–6, Ǫlv \emph{Þórr}, \emph{EVald} Þórr, and Ggnæv \emph{Þórr}.  In their present state the fragments are not complete narratives, but specifically focus on Thunder in the boat facing off against the hooked Wyrm pressed against the gunwale.  They also disagree on the course of events; in some of them the staring contest ends when the cowardly Hymer cuts the fishing line and the Wyrm sinks back unscathed into the sea (the version preferred by \Gylfaginning\ 48)—in others Thunder strikes the head off the Wyrm, slaying it.

In addition to literary sources there are also numerous pictorial depictions of the myth from the Wiking Age.  These are the Swedish runestones from Altuna (U 1611) and Linga (Sö 352), several Jutlandic picture stones from Hørdum, a Cumbrian picture stone from Gosforth, and the Gotlandic picture stone GP 21 from Ardre church.  The images depict the same scene as the Scaldic fragments: Thunder stands in the boat above the hooked Wyrm, often depicted as a fish; next to him is one companion.  Some of them have additional details like the use of the ox-head for bait (U 1611, Sö 352), or Thunder’s foot going through the boat (U 1611, Hørdum).

Other than \textlink{Hymiskvida} the only complete retelling of the myth is found in \Gylfaginning\ 48, which may be summarized as follows:

\begin{quote}{\small Thunder goes out alone into Middenyard in the shape of a young man (\emph{ungr dręngr}) without his goats and chariot.  In the evening he comes to the ettin Hymer and asks to stay the night.  At dawn Hymer plans to go fishing and Thunder asks to join him.  Hymer says that Thunder will not be of much help since he is “small and but a young man” (\emph{lítill ok ungmęnni ęitt}), and warns him that he usually takes long and arduous trips.  Thunder, angered, says that he will row very far, and then asks Hymer what bait they will use.  Hymer tells him to find it himself, and so he turns to his flock of oxen; he tears off the head from the greatest ox, one called Heavenrid (\emph{Himin-hrjóðr}).

The two go out to sea, and Thunder rows far past Hymer’s usual fishing waters.  Hymer, unhappy, warns him that if they row any further out they will be in danger of the Middenyardswyrm, but Thunder keeps on.  After some time he puts down the oars, readies his fishing line, hooks the ox-head and lowers it.  The Wyrm soon bites, and struggles so hard that Thunder is pressed against the gunwale.  In rage he brings himself into his Os-might (\emph{ǫ́s-męgin}) and pulls back with such force that his feet go through the bottom of the ship and press into the seabed.  The Wyrm's head goes up against the gunwale.  The two enemies ferociously stare at each other, Thunder “sharpening his eyes” and the Wyrm spitting venom.  Hymer is frightened, reaches for his bait-cutting knife, and cuts the line—the Wyrm then sinks back into the sea.  Thunder throws his hammer after it, “and men say that he struck off the monster’s head, but I think it true to tell thee that the Middenyardswyrm still lives and is lying in the outer sea.”  Thunder gives Hymer a punch to the ear so that he flies headfirst overboard; the god then wades back to land.}\end{quote}

This account is clearly based on multiple sources, certainly including the Scaldic fragments cited in \Skaldskaparmal.  It is hard to say whether Snorre had access to \textlink{Hymiskvida}; the closest agreement is when it is said that \emph{Miðgarðs-ormr gein yfir uxa-hǫfuð’it, en ǫngull’inn vá í góm’inn orm’inum} ‘The Middenyardswyrm snapped at the ox-head and the hook went into the roof of the wyrm’s mouth’, which has some resemblance to st. 22, but it is not conclusive.  Some details must derive from now-lost texts available to Snorre: the detail of Thunder’s feet going through the boat is also found on the Swedish Altuna stone and the Danish Hørdum stone (but see note to st. 34/2 below), and the name Heavenrid is attested in \inx[C]{thule}[thules] listing names of oxen.

More broadly, Thunder’s fishing reflects the archetypal fight between the Storm-god and the Dragon found in a great many mythologies.  Important examples of this include Vedic \emph{Índra} and \emph{Vr̥trá} (\Rigveda\ 1.32 et c.), Babylonian \emph{Marduk} and \emph{Tiamat} (\emph{Enūma Eliš} TODO), Greek \textgreek{Ζεύς} (\emph{Zeús}) and \textgreek{Τῡφῶν} (\emph{Tūphôn}), Hebrew YHWH and Leviathan (TODO: references).  With these analogies in mind it seems that the versions where Thunder slays the Wyrm reflect an older layer of Germanic mythology, before the lethal fight between Thunder and the Wyrm had been transposed to the End Times (see \textlink{Voluspa}[53]).

\subsubsection{\textlink{Hymiskvida} as a composite}

The narrative of \textlink{Hymiskvida} can be subdivided into the following episodes:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 1–6 The Gods wish to drink, and Thunder goes to Eagre to make him host; Eagre in turn asks for a cauldron big enough to brew enough ale for all the Gods.
  \item 7–16 Thunder and Tew go to visit Tew’s father, the stingy ettin Hymer, who owns such a cauldron; horrified at Thunder’s great appetite during the evening he tells them that they must go fishing for food.
  \item 17–19 Thunder says that he will do it, if he is given bait; Hymer challenges him to kill one of his oxen; Thunder tears off the head from one of them.
  \item 20–25 The three go fishing; Hymer pulls up some whales; with the ox-head as bait Thunder manages to hook the Middenyardswyrm itself; he loses it.
  \item 26–27 Hymer challenges Thunder to carry the boat and whales back to his farm; he does.
  \item 28–32 Hymer challenges Thunder to break a supposedly indestructible chalice; he succeeds by smashing it against the ettin’s forehead.
  \item 33–36 Thunder and Tew depart with the cauldron; they find themselves followed by Hymer and his ettins; Thunder kills them all.
  \item 37–38 One of Thunder’s goats goes halt.
  \item 39 Thunder returns to the Gods with Hymer’s cauldron; they host a banquet.
\end{enumerate}

The fishing expedition, as found in the Scaldic fragments and \Gylfaginning\ 48, is represented by 3–4.  \textlink{Hymiskvida} is the only source that places it within the context of Thunder and Tew obtaining a huge cauldron from Hymer for the sake of brewing ale, and also scatters several other incidents throughout.  It seems inescapable to admit, both from the other sources just mentioned and the broader comparative mythology, that these additional narratives originally had nothing to do with Thunder’s encounter with the Wyrm.  These episodes have in any case been woven together into a single narrative, perhaps even by the poet himself, for the sake of a more entertaining and complete story.

Although generally skilful, this weaving has not been entirely successful, and there are a few loose threads.  The halt goat of sts. 37–38 finds a parallel in \Gylfaginning\ 44, where it serves as the origin story of Thunder’s two servants who are to play an important part in the narrative, but in \textlink{Hymiskvida} it is an entirely superfluous detail—something the poet himself anticipates in his address to the audience.  It is also strange that Lock should appear so late in the poem when he is not mentioned before or after.

A major loose strand is the god Tew, who plays no role at all in the fishing expedition: he is last alluded to in st. 16 where Hymer speaks of “[us] three”, only to reappear in st. 33 where he fails to lift the cauldron.  The simplest explanation for this is that Tew originally had nothing to do with the encounter between Thunder and the Wyrm, and (within the confines of \textlink{Hymiskvida}) only exists to segue from the narrative of the cauldron-fetching to the fishing expedition.  This is supported by the fact that Thunder in the other variants of the expedition only has one companion—Hymer.  That includes the pictoral depictions, which only show two figures on the boat.  Another strangeness is Tew’s complete lack of a reaction to the murder of his father taking place in front of him (sts. 35–36), although that paternity is in doubt, since Tew is elsewhere called the son of \inx[P]{Weden} (\Skaldskaparmal\ 16).  If that indeed be the case, Weden would have slept with Tew’s mother, the beautiful woman of st. 8, which would reflect the motif of a god mating with a beautiful ettin-woman as seen e.g. in \textlink{Skirnismal}.

\subsection{Style}

When speaking of a composite poem, one must distinguish between a text where several originally separate works have been put together mostly unchanged, and a text composed by a single author drawing from multiple narrative sources.  A likely example of the former is \textlink{Havamal}, but \textlink{Hymiskvida} undoubtedly belongs to the latter category.  It has a distinct style and rhythm throughout which stands alone in the Poetic Edda.  Indeed, the sharpest stylistic contrast is with the poem most similar content-wise—\textlink{Thrymskvida}.  Where \textlink{Thrymskvida} is written in a rustic style with fairly loose \Fornyrdislag\ meter, \textlink{Hymiskvida} uses an unusually strict meter and is filled with kennings, difficult grammatical constructions, and highly unnatural word order (see especially sts. 16, 20, and 39).  These are all traits one associates more closely with Scaldic poetry in intricate measures like \Drottkvett\ than Eddic poetry in \Fornyrdislag, and it seems clear that the anonymous poet of \textlink{Hymiskvida} had some training in the Scaldic art and familiarity with compositions in that genre.  Two kennings (17/4a \emph{brjótr berg-Dana}, 22/4 \emph{umb-gjǫrð allra landa}) are even shared identically with Scaldic poems in \Drottkvett.

\subsubsection{Meter}

The meter of \textlink{Hymiskvida} is \Fornyrdislag, but of a stricter variant than that of any other poem in the Poetic Edda; this is especially true when it comes to the count and weight of syllables.  Three-syllable lines are rare, and the ones that do exist can all be corrected by restoring older hiatus forms (see note to 23/1b below).  The poet also has a notable tendency to avoid lines of type C1 (xP\#Px) where both stresses are heavy, something shared with Scaldic poems in \Kviduhattr\ and with Eyel’s Headransom.  This probably explains his unique obsession with placing the two-syllable preposition \emph{fyrir} ‘before, in front, (up) ahead’ at the end of the b-verse (never the a-verse), which he does 6 times—more frequently than in any other \Fornyrdislag\ poem of the Poetic Edda.

\Ballnote{Sts. 37–38 deal with one of Thunder’s goats going halt and an ettin farmer giving up two of his children in return.  A related story is also found in \Gylfaginning\ 44 and may be summarized as follows:

Thunder and Lock were on the way to visit Outyards-Lock and stayed the night with a certain farmer.  For supper Thunder cut his two goats and invited the farmer and his family to dine with him.  After they had eaten he spread the goatskins before the fire and bade the housefolk throw the bones of the goats on top of them.  The farmer’s son stealthily pried open the thigh of one of the goats and ate the marrow.  At dawn Thunder blessed the goatskins with his hammer and the goats came back to life, but the one Thelve had cut had a halt leg.  Thunder was enraged, but the farmer begged for his life and offered to give up his two children, namely his son Thelve his daughter and Wrash.  Thunder spared him, and the two became his servants.

The present stanza may reference a version of the same myth wherein Lock has a part to play in the halting of the goat, perhaps by encouraging Thelve to pry the bone open; this is strongly supported by \Skaldskaparmal\ 23 where Lock is called \emph{þjóf [...] hafrs} ‘thief of the he-goat’, almost certainly Thunder’s.  The farmer of \Gylfaginning\ may be identified with Eyel, with whom the goats were left in st. 7 above; it is probably also Eyel who gives away his two children in st. 38.}%

It clearly belongs with \emph{hvęrjan} ‘every, each’ masc. acc. sg. and must thus be a masculine; its nom. sg.  form should be \emph{*hǫr-męitiðr}.  I see this as a compound formed from \emph{hǫrr} ‘flax, cord’ + \emph{męita} ‘to cut’ with an agent noun suffix \emph{-ðr}.  Since the pronoun \emph{hvęrjan} implies seasonality the word is easily read as a kenning for \textsc{summer} or specifically the time when flax is cut around late July.
This is however unprecedented amongst kennings for \textsc{summer}, which otherwise always belong to the type “mercy of the \textsc{serpent}” \parencite[109]{Meissner1921}. —
Following the ms. evidence the pres. ed. reads \emph{ęitt} ‘one’ n. acc. sg. as modifying \emph{ǫlðr} ‘ale-feast’, but based on typical \textsc{winter}-kennings of the type “harm of the \textsc{serpent}” \textcite[46]{LaFargeGlossary} suggest the emendations \emph{ęit\emph{r}-hǫr-męiti\emph{r}} ‘venom-rope-cutter \ken{snake > winter}’ and \emph{ęit\emph{r}-*orm-\emph{m}ęi\emph{ð}i\emph{r}} ‘venom-worm-schather \ken{winter}’.}}.}%

The fact that this is mentioned at the very end of the poem seems to give an etiological purpose to the whole narrative; with the claiming of the cauldron the Gods are henceforth able to enjoy an abundance of drink at a specified point each year.  The festival alluded to is probably equivalent to an annual festival (bloot) celebrated by humans since the cult of the Gods serves as the model for the human religion (\textlink{Voluspa}[7]/2 n.), and with that in mind we can deduce that \textlink{Hymiskvida} was probably composed for recitation either at a festival taking place in late July or at Yule—a unique insight into the performance of Eddic poetry.  This is further supported by the address of the audience in st. 38 above. —
The word order is unusually complex for an Eddic poem, but that is not unprecedented in \textlink{Hymiskvida} (e.g. st. 16/3–4).  In prose word order: \emph{en véar skulu drikka vęl ęitt ǫlðr at Ę́gis hvęrjan hǫr-męitið}; or with emendation from \citeauthor{LaFargeGlossary}: \emph{en véar skulu drikka vęl ǫlðr at Ę́gis hvęrjan ęitr-hǫr-męitið.}}}\eva
