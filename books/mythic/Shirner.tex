\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Speeches of Shirner} (\textlink{Skirnismal}) is attested in full in both \Regius\ and \AM.  The name \emph{Skírnis-mǫ́l} ‘Speeches of Shirner’ comes from \AM; \Regius\ instead has \emph{Fǫr Skírnis} ‘Shirner’s journey’.

\subsection{The \Gylfaginning\ paraphrase}

The narrative of \textlink{Skirnismal} is summarised in \Gylfaginning\ 37, which also quotes st. 42.  \Gylfaginning\ 37 begins with a long introduction corresponding to \textlink{Skirnismal}[P1]–2:

\begin{quote}{\small ‘Gymer was the name of a man, and his woman was Earbode; she was of the lineage of mountain-risers.  Their daughter is Gird who is fairest of all women.

It was one day when Free had gone to the Lithshelf and looked out over all the Homes.  And when he looked north he saw on a farm a large and fair house, and to that house walked a woman, and when she lifted her hands and closed the doors behind her it shone from her hands into both the air and the waters, and all the homes were brightened by her.

onAnd the beauty which he had beheld from the holy seat harmed him so greatly that he walked away filled with grief, and when he came home he said nothing; he neither slept nor drank.  No one dared to get words out of him.’}\end{quote}

After this it paraphrases sts. 3–9, describing Shirner’s interaction with Free:

\begin{quote}{\small ‘Then Nearth had Shirner, Free’s shoe-swain, summoned before him and asked him to go to Free and bid him to speak and ask at whom he was so wroth that he would not speak with men.  And Shirner said that he would go, although not eagerly, and said that he expected ill answers from him.

And when he came to Free he asked why Free was so downcast and spoke nothing with men.  Then Free answers, and said that he had seen a fair woman and for her sakes was he so full of grief that he would not live long if he should not reach her, “and now shalt thou journey to ask for her hand on my behalf, and bring her home hither whether her father wants to or not, and I shall reward thee well for that.”

Then Shirner answers; said so, that he will go on the errand-journey, but Free shall give him his sword; it was such a good sword that it struck by itself.  And Free did not deny him that and gave him the sword.’}\end{quote}

The rest of the poem (sts. 10–38) is summarised very succinctly:

\begin{quote}{\small ‘Then Shirner journeyed and asked for the woman’s hand for him [Free] and got her promise that nine nights later she would come to that place which is called Barrey and have a wedding with Free.  And when Shirner told Free his errand then he quoth this:’}\end{quote}

The text then cites a closely related variant of stanza 42.  It lastly explains that \emph{Þessi sǫk er til þess, er Freyr var svá vápn-lauss, er hann barðist við Belja ok drap hann með hjartar-horni.} ‘This event (viz. Free’s giving of his sword) is the reason for why Free was so unarmed when he fought against \inx[P]{Bellower} and slew him with a hart’s antler.’

It seems near-certain that the author of \Gylfaginning\ had access to \textlink{Skirnismal} directly rather than a prose retelling of the story.  There is no detail in his paraphrase that is not found in the \Regius-version of the poem, although the introductory prose differs a fair bit and Shirner’s curse is entirely omitted.  These circumstances are easily explained if the version of \textlink{Skirnismal} underlying \Gylfaginning\ were written down based on oral tradition; the poetry, being in bound form, would remain largely stable, while the introductory prose would vary with each retelling.  To sum up a narrative mythic poem in prose form and then quote one or two stanzas is something probably done elsewhere in \Gylfaginning; see \textlink{EddicFragments} below.

\Ballnote{Shirner begins his coercion of Gird, which takes up sts. 19–36.
It has been noted by \textcite{Brate1913} that the structure of this coercion bears some resemblance to Weden’s seduction of Wrind in \textcite{Saxo} 3.4.1–8.  Shirner first offers Gird gold (sts. 19–22), then threatens her with violence (23–25) and finally curses her with a long spell (26–36), which breaks her.  In Weden’s seduction of Wrind he disguises as a warrior, then as a gold-smith, then again as a warrior but is spurned each time.  Finally he makes out to be a witch, and having tied Wrind down, proceeds to rape her (cf. \textlink{Voluspa}[31] n.)  If the first disguise is omitted, we see in both texts a three-fold progression consisting of giving gold, using force of arms, and at last employing magic.}%

Its nature was such that every ninth night eight even-heavy golden rings dripped from it.’
The Eese later regained the bigh, which is presumably why Shirner can promise to give it.  \Gylfaginning\ 49 tells us that when the god \inx[P]{Harmod} rode to \inx[P]{Hell} to try to bring Balder back, Balder instead gave Harmod the bigh, and told him to bring it back to Weden as a token to remember him by.}} þér þȧ gef’k, \hld\ þann’s \alst{b}ręnndr vas &
