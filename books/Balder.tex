\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{Dreams of Balder} (\Baldrsdraumar) are not preserved in \Regius, but rather in the early C14th ms. \AM.  The poem also survives in much younger paper mss., where a number of post-mediæval stanzas have been inserted.

The poem begins \emph{in medias res}; \inx[P]{Balder} has been having nightmares, which the Gods meet at the Thing to discuss (1).  \inx[P]{Weden} rides to \inx[L]{Hell}, where he has an encounter with a bloody hound; he passes it and continues to “the high house of \inx[P]{Hell}” (2–3), from which he rides west, to the grave of a certain \inx[C]{wallow} whom he revives using magic (4). She asks which man has forced her out of the grave (5), and Weden introduces himself as Waytame, before asking for whom the benches of Hell are covered with gold (6). The wallow responds that barrels of mead stand brewed for Balder and that the gods are very anxious (7). Weden asks her who will slay Balder (8), and she responds that it is Hath, carrying a “high fame-beam” (9).  Weden asks who will avenge Balder’s death (10), the wallow responds that \inx[P]{Rind} will give birth to Weden’s son \inx[P]{Wonnel}, who will slay Hath when only one night old (11).  Weden then asks about some mysterious maidens (12), which apparently betrays his identity.  The wallow announces that she now knows that it is Weden, who in turn retorts that she is not a wallow, but rather the “mother of three thurses” (13). The wallow tells him to ride home and “be famous” and taunts him over his unavoidable death at the \inx[L]{Rakes of the Reins} (14).

The Eese relayed this message, and “the men and the animals and the earth and the stones and trees and all metals” cried for Balder. It may be that these maidens were included among the grievers (perhaps they were the walkirries, and this is what reveals Weden’s identity?), but their identity is otherwise unknown.
