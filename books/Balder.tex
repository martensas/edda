In ancient manuscripts only preserved in \AM, but the poem also survives in later manuscripts with a few extra stanzas (see below). It follows the structure of a riddle contest.

The poem begins \emph{in medias res}; \inx[P]{Balder} has been having nightmares, and so the gods meet at the Thing to figure out why (1). \inx[P]{Weden} rides to \inx[L]{Hell}, where he has an encounter with a bloody dog (2). It barks for a long time at him, but he passes it and continues to “the high house of \inx[P]{Hell}” (3), from which he rides west, to the grave of a certain \inx[C]{wallow}, whom he revives using magic (4). She asks which man has forced her out of the grave (5), and Weden introduces himself as Waytame, before asking for whom the benches of Hell are covered with gold (6). The wallow responds that barrels of mead stand brewed for Balder and that the gods are very anxious (7). Weden asks her who will slay Balder (8), and she responds that it is Hath, carrying a “high fame-beam” (9). Weden then asks her who will avenge Balder’s death by slaying Hath (10). The wallow responds that \inx[P]{Rind} will give birth to Weden’s son \inx[P]{Wonnel}, who will slay Hath when only one night old (11). Weden then asks about some mysterious maidens (12; see Note), which betrays his identity. The wallow tells him that she now knows his true identity, to which Weden responds that he does as well: she is not a wallow, but rather the “mother of three thurses” (13). The wallow tells him to ride home and “be famous”; he must still die at the \inx[L]{Rakes of the Reins} (14).

The Eese relayed this message, and “the men and the animals and the earth and the stones and trees and all metals” cried for Balder. It may be that these maidens were included among the grievers (perhaps they were the walkirries, and this is what reveals Weden’s identity?), but their identity is otherwise unknown.}”\evb
