# edda

New Poetic Edda edition and translation, along with a few additional poems and spells collected from other sources, including texts in Old Saxon, Old High German and Old English. The original poetry is edited from the surviving manuscript witnesses, then translated in a word-for-word style, with close attention paid to internal consistency and the specialized senses of words. Proper nouns and cultural terms are rendered in their Anglish equivalents.
