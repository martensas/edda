# edda

Creative commons poetic edda translation.

## Download

There is a .pdf available with a few poems already in it (for details, see main.tex).

Want to have a smaller file containing only the poems you're interested in? Download the source code (i.e. the root folder "edda"), uncomment the ones you want by removing the hashtags before them, and then compile main.tex in XeLaTeX with your favourite TeX program. Note that many poems currently commented out do not yet exist as files, and so will throw an error if you try to include them.
